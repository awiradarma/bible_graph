jerusalem_636,publish,Jerusalem,"Zion, Jebus, Salem, City of God",City,Precise,31.776667,35.234167,,https://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/eastons-bible-dictionary/jerusalem.html," called also Salem, Ariel, Jebus, the ""city of God,"" the ""holy city;"" by the modern Arabs el-Khuds, meaning ""the holy;"" once ""the city of Judah"" ( 2 Chronicles 25:28  ). This name is in the original in the dual form, and means ""possession of peace,"" or ""foundation of peace."" The dual form probably refers to the two mountains on which it was built, viz., Zion and Moriah; or, as some suppose, to the two parts of the city, the ""upper"" and the ""lower city."" Jerusalem is a ""mountain city enthroned on a mountain fastness"" (Compare  Psalms 68:15  Psalms 68:16  ;  87:1  ;  125:2  ;  Psalms 76:1  Psalms 76:2  ;  122:3  ). It stands on the edge of one of the highest table-lands in Palestine, and is surrounded on the south-eastern, the southern, and the western sides by deep and precipitous ravines.    It is first mentioned in Scripture under the name Salem ( Genesis 14:18  ; Compare  Psalms 76:2  ). When first mentioned under the name Jerusalem, Adonizedek was its king ( Joshua 10:1  ). It is afterwards named among the cities of Benjamin ( Judges 19:10  ;  1 Chronicles 11:4  ); but in the time of David it was divided between Benjamin and Judah. After the death of Joshua the city was taken and set on fire by the men of Judah ( Judges 1:1-8  ); but the Jebusites were not wholly driven out of it. The city is not again mentioned till we are told that David brought the head of Goliath thither ( 1 Samuel 17:54  ). David afterwards led his forces against the Jebusites still residing within its walls, and drove them out, fixing his own dwelling on Zion, which he called ""the city of David"" ( 2 Samuel 5:5-9  ;  1 Chronicles 11:4-8  ). Here he built an altar to the Lord on the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite ( 2 Samuel 24:15-25  ), and thither he brought up the ark of the covenant and placed it in the new tabernacle which he had prepared for it. Jerusalem now became the capital of the kingdom.    After the death of David, Solomon built the temple, a house for the name of the Lord, on Mount Moriah (B.C. 1010). He also greatly strengthened and adorned the city, and it became the great centre of all the civil and religious affairs of the nation ( Deuteronomy 12:5  ; comp  12:14  ;  14:23  ;  16:11-16  ;  Psalms 122  ).    After the disruption of the kingdom on the accession to the throne of Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, Jerusalem became the capital of the kingdom of the two tribes. It was subsequently often taken and retaken by the Egyptians, the Assyrians, and by the kings of Israel ( 2 Kings 14:13  2 Kings 14:14  ;  2 Kings 18:15  2 Kings 18:16  ;  23:33-35  ;  24:14  ;  2  Chr  12:9  ;   26:9  ;   2 Kings 27:3   2 Kings 27:4  ;   29:3  ;   32:30  ;   33:11  ), till finally, for the abounding iniquities of the nation, after a siege of three years, it was taken and utterly destroyed, its walls razed to the ground, and its temple and palaces consumed by fire, by Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon ( 2 Kings 25  ;  2  Chr.   36  ;  Jeremiah 39  ), B.C. 588. The desolation of the city and the land was completed by the retreat of the principal Jews into Egypt (  Jeremiah 4044  -44), and by the final carrying captive into Babylon of all that still remained in the land ( 52:3  ), so that it was left without an inhabitant (B.C. 582). Compare the predictions,  Deuteronomy 28  ;  Leviticus 26:14-39  .    But the streets and walls of Jerusalem were again to be built, in troublous times ( Daniel 9:16  Daniel 9:19  Daniel 9:25  ), after a captivity of seventy years. This restoration was begun B.C. 536, ""in the first year of Cyrus"" ( Ezra 1:2  Ezra 1:3  Ezra 1:5-11  ). The Books of Ezra and Nehemiah contain the history of the re-building of the city and temple, and the restoration of the kingdom of the Jews, consisting of a portion of all the tribes. The kingdom thus constituted was for two centuries under the dominion of Persia, till B.C. 331; and thereafter, for about a century and a half, under the rulers of the Greek empire in Asia, till B.C. 167. For a century the Jews maintained their independence under native rulers, the Asmonean princes. At the close of this period they fell under the rule of Herod and of members of his family, but practically under Rome, till the time of the destruction of Jerusalem, A.D. 70. The city was then laid in ruins.    The modern Jerusalem by-and-by began to be built over the immense beds of rubbish resulting from the overthrow of the ancient city; and whilst it occupies certainly the same site, there are no evidences that even the lines of its streets are now what they were in the ancient city. Till A.D. 131 the Jews who still lingered about Jerusalem quietly submitted to the Roman sway. But in that year the emperor (Hadrian), in order to hold them in subjection, rebuilt and fortified the city. The Jews, however, took possession of it, having risen under the leadership of one Bar-Chohaba (i.e., ""the son of the star"") in revolt against the Romans. Some four years afterwards (A.D. 135), however, they were driven out of it with great slaughter, and the city was again destroyed; and over its ruins was built a Roman city called Aelia Capitolina, a name which it retained till it fell under the dominion of the Mohammedans, when it was called el-Khuds, i.e., ""the holy.""    In A.D. 326 Helena, mother of the emperor Constantine, made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem with the view of discovering the places mentioned in the life of our Lord. She caused a church to be built on what was then supposed to be the place of the nativity at Bethlehem. Constantine, animated by her example, searched for the holy sepulchre, and built over the supposed site a magnificent church, which was completed and dedicated A.D. 335. He relaxed the laws against the Jews till this time in force, and permitted them once a year to visit the city and wail over the desolation of ""the holy and beautiful house.""    In A.D. 614 the Persians, after defeating the Roman forces of the emperor Heraclius, took Jerusalem by storm, and retained it till A.D. 637, when it was taken by the Arabians under the Khalif Omar. It remained in their possession till it passed, in A.D. 960, under the dominion of the Fatimite khalifs of Egypt, and in A.D. 1073 under the Turcomans. In A.D. 1099 the crusader Godfrey of Bouillon took the city from the Moslems with great slaughter, and was elected king of Jerusalem. He converted the Mosque of Omar into a Christian cathedral. During the eighty-eight years which followed, many churches and convents were erected in the holy city. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was rebuilt during this period, and it alone remains to this day. In A.D. 1187 the sultan Saladin wrested the city from the Christians. From that time to the present day, with few intervals, Jerusalem has remained in the hands of the Moslems. It has, however, during that period been again and again taken and retaken, demolished in great part and rebuilt, no city in the world having passed through so many vicissitudes.    In the year 1850 the Greek and Latin monks residing in Jerusalem had a fierce dispute about the guardianship of what are called the ""holy places."" In this dispute the emperor Nicholas of Russia sided with the Greeks, and Louis Napoleon, the emperor of the French, with the Latins. This led the Turkish authorities to settle the question in a way unsatisfactory to Russia. Out of this there sprang the Crimean War, which was protracted and sanguinary, but which had important consequences in the way of breaking down the barriers of Turkish exclusiveness.    Modern Jerusalem ""lies near the summit of a broad mountain-ridge, which extends without interruption from the plain of Esdraelon to a line drawn between the southern end of the Dead Sea and the southeastern corner of the Mediterranean."" This high, uneven table-land is everywhere from 20 to 25 geographical miles in breadth. It was anciently known as the mountains of Ephraim and Judah.    ""Jerusalem is a city of contrasts, and differs widely from Damascus, not merely because it is a stone town in mountains, whilst the latter is a mud city in a plain, but because while in Damascus Moslem religion and Oriental custom are unmixed with any foreign element, in Jerusalem every form of religion, every nationality of East and West, is represented at one time.""   Jerusalem is first mentioned under that name in the Book of Joshua, and the Tell-el-Amarna collection of tablets includes six letters from its Amorite king to Egypt, recording the attack of the Abiri about B.C. 1480. The name is there spelt Uru-Salim (""city of peace""). Another monumental record in which the Holy City is named is that of Sennacherib's attack in B.C. 702. The ""camp of the Assyrians"" was still shown about A.D. 70, on the flat ground to the north-west, included in the new quarter of the city.    The city of David included both the upper city and Millo, and was surrounded by a wall built by David and Solomon, who appear to have restored the original Jebusite fortifications. The name Zion (or Sion) appears to have been, like Ariel (""the hearth of God""), a poetical term for Jerusalem, but in the Greek age was more specially used of the Temple hill. The priests' quarter grew up on Ophel, south of the Temple, where also was Solomon's Palace outside the original city of David. The walls of the city were extended by Jotham and Manasseh to include this suburb and the Temple ( 2 Chronicles 27:3  ;  33:14  ).    Jerusalem is now a town of some 50,000 inhabitants, with ancient mediaeval walls, partly on the old lines, but extending less far to the south. The traditional sites, as a rule, were first shown in the 4th and later centuries A.D., and have no authority. The results of excavation have, however, settled most of the disputed questions, the limits of the Temple area, and the course of the old walls having been traced.

egypt_362,publish,Egypt,,Region,Related-Surrounding,26.4902014068366,29.88079617,region,https://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/eastons-bible-dictionary/egypt.html," the land of the Nile and the pyramids, the oldest kingdom of which we have any record, holds a place of great significance in Scripture.   The Egyptians belonged to the white race, and their original home is still a matter of dispute. Many scholars believe that it was in Southern Arabia, and recent excavations have shown that the valley of the Nile was originally inhabited by a low-class population, perhaps belonging to the Nigritian stock, before the Egyptians of history entered it. The ancient Egyptian language, of which the latest form is Coptic, is distantly connected with the Semitic family of speech.   Egypt consists geographically of two halves, the northern being the Delta, and the southern Upper Egypt, between Cairo and the First Cataract. In the Old Testament, Northern or Lower Egypt is called Mazor, ""the fortified land"" ( Isaiah 19:6  ;  37:  :  25  , where the A.V. mistranslates ""defence"" and ""besieged places""); while Southern or Upper Egypt is Pathros, the Egyptian Pa-to-Res, or ""the land of the south"" ( Isaiah 11:11  ). But the whole country is generally mentioned under the dual name of Mizraim, ""the two Mazors.""    The civilization of Egypt goes back to a very remote antiquity. The two kingdoms of the north and south were united by Menes, the founder of the first historical dynasty of kings. The first six dynasties constitute what is known as the Old Empire, which had its capital at Memphis, south of Cairo, called in the Old Testament Moph ( Hosea 9:6  ) and Noph. The native name was Mennofer, ""the good place.""    The Pyramids were tombs of the monarchs of the Old Empire, those of Gizeh being erected in the time of the Fourth Dynasty. After the fall of the Old Empire came a period of decline and obscurity. This was followed by the Middle Empire, the most powerful dynasty of which was the Twelfth. The Fayyum was rescued for agriculture by the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty; and two obelisks were erected in front of the temple of the sun-god at On or Heliopolis (near Cairo), one of which is still standing. The capital of the Middle Empire was Thebes, in Upper Egypt.   The Middle Empire was overthrown by the invasion of the Hyksos, or shepherd princes from Asia, who ruled over Egypt, more especially in the north, for several centuries, and of whom there were three dynasties of kings. They had their capital at Zoan or Tanis (now San), in the north-eastern part of the Delta. It was in the time of the Hyksos that Abraham, Jacob, and Joseph entered Egypt. The Hyksos were finally expelled about B.C. 1600, by the hereditary princes of Thebes, who founded the Eighteenth Dynasty, and carried the war into Asia. Canaan and Syria were subdued, as well as Cyprus, and the boundaries of the Egyptian Empire were fixed at the Euphrates. The Soudan, which had been conquered by the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty, was again annexed to Egypt, and the eldest son of the Pharaoh took the title of ""Prince of Cush.""    One of the later kings of the dynasty, Amenophis IV., or Khu-n-Aten, endeavoured to supplant the ancient state religion of Egypt by a new faith derived from Asia, which was a sort of pantheistic monotheism, the one supreme god being adored under the image of the solar disk. The attempt led to religious and civil war, and the Pharaoh retreated from Thebes to Central Egypt, where he built a new capital, on the site of the present Tell-el-Amarna. The cuneiform tablets that have been found there represent his foreign correspondence (about B.C. 1400). He surrounded himself with officials and courtiers of Asiatic, and more especially Canaanitish, extraction; but the native party succeeded eventually in overthrowing the government, the capital of Khu-n-Aten was destroyed, and the foreigners were driven out of the country, those that remained being reduced to serfdom.    The national triumph was marked by the rise of the Nineteenth Dynasty, in the founder of which, Rameses I., we must see the ""new king, who knew not Joseph."" His grandson, Rameses II., reigned sixty-seven years (B.C. 1348-1281), and was an indefatigable builder. As Pithom, excavated by Dr. Naville in 1883, was one of the cities he built, he must have been the Pharaoh of the Oppression. The Pharaoh of the Exodus may have been one of his immediate successors, whose reigns were short. Under them Egypt lost its empire in Asia, and was itself attacked by barbarians from Libya and the north.    The Nineteenth Dynasty soon afterwards came to an end; Egypt was distracted by civil war; and for a short time a Canaanite, Arisu, ruled over it.   Then came the Twentieth Dynasty, the second Pharaoh of which, Rameses III., restored the power of his country. In one of his campaigns he overran the southern part of Palestine, where the Israelites had not yet settled. They must at the time have been still in the wilderness. But it was during the reign of Rameses III. that Egypt finally lost Gaza and the adjoining cities, which were seized by the Pulista, or Philistines.   After Rameses III., Egypt fell into decay. Solomon married the daughter of one of the last kings of the Twenty-first Dynasty, which was overthrown by Shishak I., the general of the Libyan mercenaries, who founded the Twenty-second Dynasty ( 1 Kings 11:40  ;  1 Kings 14:25  1 Kings 14:26  ). A list of the places he captured in Palestine is engraved on the outside of the south wall of the temple of Karnak.    In the time of Hezekiah, Egypt was conquered by Ethiopians from the Soudan, who constituted the Twenty-fifth Dynasty. The third of them was Tirhakah ( 2 Kings 19:9  ). In B.C. 674 it was conquered by the Assyrians, who divided it into twenty satrapies, and Tirhakah was driven back to his ancestral dominions. Fourteen years later it successfully revolted under Psammetichus I. of Sais, the founder of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty. Among his successors were Necho ( 2 Kings 23:29  ) and Hophra, or Apries ( Jeremiah 37:5  Jeremiah 37:7  Jeremiah 37:11  ). The dynasty came to an end in B.C. 525, when the country was subjugated by Cambyses. Soon afterwards it was organized into a Persian satrapy.    The title of Pharaoh, given to the Egyptian kings, is the Egyptian Per-aa, or ""Great House,"" which may be compared to that of ""Sublime Porte."" It is found in very early Egyptian texts.   The Egyptian religion was a strange mixture of pantheism and animal worship, the gods being adored in the form of animals. While the educated classes resolved their manifold deities into manifestations of one omnipresent and omnipotent divine power, the lower classes regarded the animals as incarnations of the gods.   Under the Old Empire, Ptah, the Creator, the god of Memphis, was at the head of the Pantheon; afterwards Amon, the god of Thebes, took his place. Amon, like most of the other gods, was identified with Ra, the sun-god of Heliopolis.   The Egyptians believed in a resurrection and future life, as well as in a state of rewards and punishments dependent on our conduct in this world. The judge of the dead was Osiris, who had been slain by Set, the representative of evil, and afterwards restored to life. His death was avenged by his son Horus, whom the Egyptians invoked as their ""Redeemer."" Osiris and Horus, along with Isis, formed a trinity, who were regarded as representing the sun-god under different forms.   Even in the time of Abraham, Egypt was a flourishing and settled monarchy. Its oldest capital, within the historic period, was Memphis, the ruins of which may still be seen near the Pyramids and the Sphinx. When the Old Empire of Menes came to an end, the seat of empire was shifted to Thebes, some 300 miles farther up the Nile. A short time after that, the Delta was conquered by the Hyksos, or shepherd kings, who fixed their capital at Zoan, the Greek Tanis, now San, on the Tanic arm of the Nile. All this occurred before the time of the new king ""which knew not Joseph"" ( Exodus 1:8  ). In later times Egypt was conquered by the Persians (B.C. 525), and by the Greeks under Alexander the Great (B.C. 332), after whom the Ptolemies ruled the country for three centuries. Subsequently it was for a time a province of the Roman Empire; and at last, in A.D. 1517, it fell into the hands of the Turks, of whose empire it still forms nominally a part. Abraham and Sarah went to Egypt in the time of the shepherd kings. The exile of Joseph and the migration of Jacob to ""the land of Goshen"" occurred about 200 years later. On the death of Solomon, Shishak, king of Egypt, invaded Palestine ( 1 Kings 14:25  ). He left a list of the cities he conquered.    A number of remarkable clay tablets, discovered at Tell-el-Amarna in Upper Egypt, are the most important historical records ever found in connection with the Bible. They most fully confirm the historical statements of the Book of Joshua, and prove the antiquity of civilization in Syria and Palestine. As the clay in different parts of Palestine differs, it has been found possible by the clay alone to decide where the tablets come from when the name of the writer is lost. The inscriptions are cuneiform, and in the Aramaic language, resembling Assyrian. The writers are Phoenicians, Amorites, and Philistines, but in no instance Hittites, though Hittites are mentioned. The tablets consist of official dispatches and letters, dating from B.C. 1480, addressed to the two Pharaohs, Amenophis III. and IV., the last of this dynasty, from the kings and governors of Phoenicia and Palestine. There occur the names of three kings killed by Joshua, Adoni-zedec, king of Jerusalem, Japhia, king of Lachish ( Joshua 10:3  ), and Jabin, king of Hazor ( 11:1  ); also the Hebrews (Abiri) are said to have come from the desert.    The principal prophecies of Scripture regarding Egypt are these,  Isaiah 19  ;  Jeremiah 43:  :   813  -13;  44:30  ;  46  ; Ezek. 29-32; and it might be easily shown that they have all been remarkably fulfilled. For example, the singular disappearance of Noph (i.e., Memphis) is a fulfilment of  Jeremiah 46:19  ,  Ezekiel 30:13  .

babylon_151,publish,Babylon,,City,Center,32.53617,44.42082,,https://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/eastons-bible-dictionary/babylon.html," the Greek form of BABEL; Semitic form Babilu, meaning ""The Gate of God."" In the Assyrian tablets it means ""The city of the dispersion of the tribes."" The monumental list of its kings reaches back to B.C. 2300, and includes Khammurabi, or Amraphel (q.v.), the contemporary of Abraham. It stood on the Euphrates, about 200 miles above its junction with the Tigris, which flowed through its midst and divided it into two almost equal parts. The Elamites invaded Chaldea (i.e., Lower Mesopotamia, or Shinar, and Upper Mesopotamia, or Accad, now combined into one) and held it in subjection. At length Khammu-rabi delivered it from the foreign yoke, and founded the new empire of Chaldea (q.v.), making Babylon the capital of the united kingdom. This city gradually grew in extent and grandeur, but in process of time it became subject to Assyria. On the fall of Nineveh (B.C. 606) it threw off the Assyrian yoke, and became the capital of the growing Babylonian empire. Under Nebuchadnezzar it became one of the most splendid cities of the ancient world.    After passing through various vicissitudes the city was occupied by Cyrus, ""king of Elam,"" B.C. 538, who issued a decree permitting the Jews to return to their own land (Ezra 1). It then ceased to be the capital of an empire. It was again and again visited by hostile armies, till its inhabitants were all driven from their homes, and the city became a complete desolation, its very site being forgotten from among men.    On the west bank of the Euphrates, about 50 miles south of Bagdad, there is found a series of artificial mounds of vast extent. These are the ruins of this once famous proud city. These ruins are principally (1) the great mound called Babil by the Arabs. This was probably the noted Temple of Belus, which was a pyramid about 480 feet high. (2) The Kasr (i.e., ""the palace""). This was the great palace of Nebuchadnezzar. It is almost a square, each side of which is about 700 feet long. The little town of Hillah, near the site of Babylon, is built almost wholly of bricks taken from this single mound. (3) A lofty mound, on the summit of which stands a modern tomb called Amran ibn-Ali. This is probably the most ancient portion of the remains of the city, and represents the ruins of the famous hanging-gardens, or perhaps of some royal palace. The utter desolation of the city once called ""The glory of kingdoms"" (Isa.13:19) was foretold by the prophets (Isa.13:4-22;  Jeremiah 25:12  ;  Jeremiah 50:2  Jeremiah 50:3  ;  Daniel 2:31-38  ).    The Babylon mentioned in  1 Peter 5:13   was not Rome, as some have thought, but the literal city of Babylon, which was inhabited by many Jews at the time Peter wrote.    In  Revelation 14:8  ;  16:19  ;  17:5  ; and  18:2  , ""Babylon"" is supposed to mean Rome, not considered as pagan, but as the prolongation of the ancient power in the papal form. Rome, pagan and papal, is regarded as one power.

samaria_1022,publish,Samaria,,Region,,32.331417,35.228586,"Acts 8:5 ""city"" of Samaria",https://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/eastons-bible-dictionary/samaria.html," a watch-mountain or a watch-tower. In the heart of the mountains of Israel, a few miles north-west of Shechem, stands the ""hill of Shomeron,"" a solitary mountain, a great ""mamelon."" It is an oblong hill, with steep but not inaccessible sides, and a long flat top. Omri, the king of Israel, purchased this hill from Shemer its owner for two talents of silver, and built on its broad summit the city to which he gave the name of ""Shomeron"", i.e., Samaria, as the new capital of his kingdom instead of Tirzah ( 1 Kings 16:24  ). As such it possessed many advantages. Here Omri resided during the last six years of his reign. As the result of an unsuccessful war with Syria, he appears to have been obliged to grant to the Syrians the right to ""make streets in Samaria"", i.e., probably permission to the Syrian merchants to carry on their trade in the Israelite capital. This would imply the existence of a considerable Syrian population. ""It was the only great city of Palestine created by the sovereign. All the others had been already consecrated by patriarchal tradition or previous possession. But Samaria was the choice of Omri alone. He, indeed, gave to the city which he had built the name of its former owner, but its especial connection with himself as its founder is proved by the designation which it seems Samaria bears in Assyrian inscriptions, Beth-khumri ('the house or palace of Omri')."", Stanley.    Samaria was frequently besieged. In the days of Ahab, Benhadad II. came up against it with thirty-two vassal kings, but was defeated with a great slaughter ( 1 Kings 20:1-21  ). A second time, next year, he assailed it; but was again utterly routed, and was compelled to surrender to Ahab ( 20:28-34  ), whose army, as compared with that of Benhadad, was no more than ""two little flocks of kids.""    In the days of Jehoram this Benhadad again laid siege to Samaria, during which the city was reduced to the direst extremities. But just when success seemed to be within their reach, they suddenly broke up the seige, alarmed by a mysterious noise of chariots and horses and a great army, and fled, leaving their camp with all its contents behind them. The famishing inhabitants of the city were soon relieved with the abundance of the spoil of the Syrian camp; and it came to pass, according to the word of Elisha, that ""a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barely for a shekel, in the gates of Samaria"" ( 2 Kings 7:1-20  ).    Shalmaneser invaded Israel in the days of Hoshea, and reduced it to vassalage. He laid siege to Samaria (B.C. 723), which held out for three years, and was at length captured by Sargon, who completed the conquest Shalmaneser had begun ( 2 Kings 18:9-12  ;  17:3  ), and removed vast numbers of the tribes into captivity. (See SARGON  .)   This city, after passing through various vicissitudes, was given by the emperor Augustus to Herod the Great, who rebuilt it, and called it Sebaste (Gr. form of Augustus) in honour of the emperor. In the New Testament the only mention of it is in  Acts 8:5-14  , where it is recorded that Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached there.    It is now represented by the hamlet of Sebustieh, containing about three hundred inhabitants. The ruins of the ancient town are all scattered over the hill, down the sides of which they have rolled. The shafts of about one hundred of what must have been grand Corinthian columns are still standing, and attract much attention, although nothing definite is known regarding them. (Compare  Micah 1:6  .)    In the time of Christ, Western Palestine was divided into three provinces, Judea, Samaria, and Galilee. Samaria occupied the centre of Palestine ( John 4:4  ). It is called in the Talmud the ""land of the Cuthim,"" and is not regarded as a part of the Holy Land at all.    It may be noticed that the distance between Samaria and Jerusalem, the respective capitals of the two kingdoms, is only 35 miles in a direct line.",114,1022,,,"peter_2745, john_1677, philip_2347, simon_2752",,"1Kgs.13.32,1Kgs.16.24,1Kgs.16.28,1Kgs.16.29,1Kgs.16.32,1Kgs.18.2,1Kgs.20.1,1Kgs.20.10,1Kgs.20.17,1Kgs.20.34,1Kgs.20.43,1Kgs.21.1,1Kgs.21.18,1Kgs.22.10,1Kgs.22.37,1Kgs.22.38,1Kgs.22.51,2Kgs.1.2,2Kgs.1.3,2Kgs.2.25,2Kgs.3.1,2Kgs.3.6,2Kgs.5.3,2Kgs.6.19,2Kgs.6.20,2Kgs.6.24,2Kgs.6.25,2Kgs.7.1,2Kgs.7.18,2Kgs.10.1,2Kgs.10.12,2Kgs.10.17,2Kgs.10.35,2Kgs.10.36,2Kgs.13.1,2Kgs.13.6,2Kgs.13.9,2Kgs.13.10,2Kgs.13.13,2Kgs.14.14,2Kgs.14.16,2Kgs.14.23,2Kgs.15.8,2Kgs.15.13,2Kgs.15.14,2Kgs.15.17,2Kgs.15.23,2Kgs.15.25,2Kgs.15.27,2Kgs.17.1,2Kgs.17.5,2Kgs.17.6,2Kgs.17.24,2Kgs.17.26,2Kgs.17.28,2Kgs.18.9,2Kgs.18.10,2Kgs.18.34,2Kgs.21.13,2Kgs.23.18,2Kgs.23.19,2Chr.18.2,2Chr.18.9,2Chr.22.9,2Chr.25.13,2Chr.25.24,2Chr.28.8,2Chr.28.9,2Chr.28.15,Ezra.4.10,Ezra.4.17,Neh.4.2,Isa.7.9,Isa.8.4,Isa.9.9,Isa.10.9,Isa.10.10,Isa.10.11,Isa.36.19,Jer.23.13,Jer.31.5,Jer.41.5,Ezek.16.46,Ezek.16.51,Ezek.16.53,Ezek.16.55,Ezek.23.4,Ezek.23.33,Hos.7.1,Hos.8.5,Hos.8.6,Hos.10.5,Hos.13.16,Amos.3.9,Amos.3.12,Amos.4.1,Amos.6.1,Obad.1.19,Mic.1.1,Mic.1.5,Mic.1.6,Luke.17.11,John.4.4,John.4.5,John.4.7,John.4.9,Acts.1.8,Acts.8.1,Acts.8.5,Acts.8.9,Acts.8.14,Acts.9.31,Acts.15.3,Hos.10.7",http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/678369,VERIFIED,region,,Samaria,3c3fd30b-f100-4fc6-baf9-9f449f3f1d6e,Samaria,2020-12-04 13:37

Aram), the name in the Old Testament given to the whole country which lay to the north-east of Phoenicia, extending to beyond the Euphrates and the Tigris. Mesopotamia is called ( Genesis 24:10  ;  Deuteronomy 23:4  ) Aram-naharain (=Syria of the two rivers), also Padan-aram ( Genesis 25:20  ). Other portions of Syria were also known by separate names, as Aram-maahah ( 1 Chronicles 19:6  ), Aram-beth-rehob ( 2 Samuel 10:6  ), Aram-zobah ( 2 Samuel 10:6  2 Samuel 10:8  ). All these separate little kingdoms afterwards became subject to Damascus. In the time of the Romans, Syria included also a part of Palestine and Asia Minor.    ""From the historic annals now accessible to us, the history of Syria may be divided into three periods: The first, the period when the power of the Pharaohs was dominant over the fertile fields or plains of Syria and the merchant cities of Tyre and Sidon, and when such mighty conquerors as Thothmes III. and Rameses II. could claim dominion and levy tribute from the nations from the banks of the Euphrates to the borders of the Libyan desert. Second, this was followed by a short period of independence, when the Jewish nation in the south was growing in power, until it reached its early zenith in the golden days of Solomon; and when Tyre and Sidon were rich cities, sending their traders far and wide, over land and sea, as missionaries of civilization, while in the north the confederate tribes of the Hittites held back the armies of the kings of Assyria. The third, and to us most interesting, period is that during which the kings of Assyria were dominant over the plains of Syria; when Tyre, Sidon, Ashdod, and Jerusalem bowed beneath the conquering armies of Shalmaneser, Sargon, and Sennacherib; and when at last Memphis and Thebes yielded to the power of the rulers of Nineveh and Babylon, and the kings of Assyria completed with terrible fulness the bruising of the reed of Egypt so clearly foretold by the Hebrew prophets."", Boscawen.

Solomon rewarded Hiram for certain services rendered him by the gift of an upland plain among the mountains of Naphtali. Hiram was dissatisfied with the gift, and called it ""the land of Cabul"" (q.v.). The Jews called it Galil. It continued long to be occupied by the original inhabitants, and hence came to be called ""Galilee of the Gentiles"" ( Matthew 4:15  ), and also ""Upper Galilee,"" to distinguish it from the extensive addition afterwards made to it toward the south, which was usually called ""Lower Galilee."" In the time of our Lord, Galilee embraced more than one-third of Western Palestine, extending ""from Dan on the north, at the base of Mount Hermon, to the ridges of Carmel and Gilboa on the south, and from the Jordan valley on the east away across the splendid plains of Jezreel and Acre to the shores of the Mediterranean on the west."" Palestine was divided into three provinces, Judea, Samaria, and Galilee, which comprehended the whole northern section of the country ( Acts 9:31  ), and was the largest of the three.    It was the scene of some of the most memorable events of Jewish history. Galilee also was the home of our Lord during at least thirty years of his life. The first three Gospels are chiefly taken up with our Lord's public ministry in this province. ""The entire province is encircled with a halo of holy associations connected with the life, works, and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth."" ""It is noteworthy that of his thirty-two beautiful parables, no less than ninteen were spoken in Galilee. And it is no less remarkable that of his entire thirty-three great miracles, twenty-five were wrought in this province. His first miracle was wrought at the wedding in Cana of Galilee, and his last, after his resurrection, on the shore of Galilee's sea. In Galilee our Lord delivered the Sermon on The Mount, and the discourses on 'The Bread of Life,' on 'Purity,' on 'Forgiveness,' and on 'Humility.' In Galilee he called his first disciples; and there occurred the sublime scene of the Transfiguration"" (Porter's Through Samaria).   When the Sanhedrin were about to proceed with some plan for the condemnation of our Lord ( John 7:45-52  ), Nicodemus interposed in his behalf. (Compare  Deuteronomy 1:16  Deuteronomy 1:17  ;  17:8  .) They replied, ""Art thou also of Galilee?.... Out of Galilee ariseth no prophet."" This saying of theirs was ""not historically true, for two prophets at least had arisen from Galilee, Jonah of Gath-hepher, and the greatest of all the prophets, Elijah of Thisbe, and perhaps also Nahum and Hosea. Their contempt for Galilee made them lose sight of historical accuracy"" (Alford, Com.).

damascus_322,publish,Damascus,,City,,33.511612,36.309102,,https://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/eastons-bible-dictionary/damascus.html," activity, the most ancient of Oriental cities; the capital of Syria ( Isaiah 7:8  ;  17:3  ); situated about 133 miles to the north of Jerusalem. Its modern name is Esh-Sham; i.e., ""the East.""    The situation of this city is said to be the most beautiful of all Western Asia. It is mentioned among the conquests of the Egyptian king Thothmes III. (B.C. 1500), and in the Amarna tablets (B.C. 1400).    It is first mentioned in Scripture in connection with Abraham's victory over the confederate kings under Chedorlaomer ( Genesis 14:15  ). It was the native place of Abraham's steward ( 15:2  ). It is not again noticed till the time of David, when ""the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer"" (q.v.),  2 Samuel 8:5  ;  1 Chronicles 18:5  . In the reign of Solomon, Rezon became leader of a band who revolted from Hadadezer ( 1 Kings 11:23  ), and betaking themselves to Damascus, settled there and made their leader king. There was a long war, with varying success, between the Israelites and Syrians, who at a later period became allies of Israel against Judah ( 2 Kings 15:37  ).    The Syrians were at length subdued by the Assyrians, the city of Damascus was taken and destroyed, and the inhabitants carried captive into Assyria ( 2 Kings 16:7-9  ; Compare  Isaiah 7:8  ). In this, prophecy was fulfilled ( Isaiah 17:1  ;  Amos 1:4  ;  Jeremiah 49:24  ). The kingdom of Syria remained a province of Assyria till the capture of Nineveh by the Medes (B.C. 625), when it fell under the conquerors. After passing through various vicissitudes, Syria was invaded by the Romans (B.C. 64), and Damascus became the seat of the government of the province. In A.D. 37 Aretas, the king of Arabia, became master of Damascus, having driven back Herod Antipas.    This city is memorable as the scene of Saul's conversion ( Acts 9:1-25  ). The street called ""Straight,"" in which Judas lived, in whose house Saul was found by Ananias, is known by the name Sultany, or ""Queen's Street."" It is the principal street of the city. Paul visited Damascus again on his return from Arabia ( Galatians 1:16  Galatians 1:17  ). Christianity was planted here as a centre ( Acts 9:20  ), from which it spread to the surrounding regions.    In A.D. 634 Damascus was conquered by the growing Mohammedan power. In A.D. 1516 it fell under the dominion of the Turks, its present rulers. It is now the largest city in Asiatic Turkey. Christianity has again found a firm footing within its walls.",55,322,,,"paul_2479, barnabas_1722, ananias_259",,"Gen.14.15,Gen.15.2,2Sam.8.5,2Sam.8.6,1Kgs.11.24,1Kgs.15.18,1Kgs.19.15,1Kgs.20.34,2Kgs.5.12,2Kgs.8.7,2Kgs.8.9,2Kgs.14.28,2Kgs.16.9,2Kgs.16.10,2Kgs.16.11,2Kgs.16.12,1Chr.18.5,1Chr.18.6,2Chr.16.2,2Chr.24.23,2Chr.28.5,2Chr.28.23,Song.7.4,Isa.7.8,Isa.8.4,Isa.10.9,Isa.17.1,Isa.17.3,Jer.49.23,Jer.49.24,Jer.49.27,Ezek.27.18,Ezek.47.16,Ezek.47.17,Ezek.47.18,Ezek.48.1,Amos.1.3,Amos.1.5,Amos.5.27,Zech.9.1,Acts.9.2,Acts.9.3,Acts.9.8,Acts.9.10,Acts.9.19,Acts.9.22,Acts.9.27,Acts.22.5,Acts.22.6,Acts.22.10,Acts.22.11,Acts.26.12,Acts.26.20,2Cor.11.32,Gal.1.17",http://dare.ht.lu.se/places/21087,VERIFIED,"settlement,temple-2,mosque",,"Damascus|Damascus, Damascus",c4ac5210-ad5f-4512-9ad6-0bf19aea8443,Damascus,2020-08-27 01:33
tyre_1184,publish,Tyre,,City,,33.268071,35.209358,,https://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/eastons-bible-dictionary/tyre.html," a rock, now es-Sur; an ancient Phoenician city, about 23 miles, in a direct line, north of Acre, and 20 south of Sidon. Sidon was the oldest Phoenician city, but Tyre had a longer and more illustrious history. The commerce of the whole world was gathered into the warehouses of Tyre. ""Tyrian merchants were the first who ventured to navigate the Mediterranean waters; and they founded their colonies on the coasts and neighbouring islands of the AEgean Sea, in Greece, on the northern coast of Africa, at Carthage and other places, in Sicily and Corsica, in Spain at Tartessus, and even beyond the pillars of Hercules at Gadeira (Cadiz)"" (Driver's Isaiah). In the time of David a friendly alliance was entered into between the Hebrews and the Tyrians, who were long ruled over by their native kings ( 2 Samuel 5:11  ;  1 Kings 5:1  ;  2  Chr  2:3  ).    Tyre consisted of two distinct parts, a rocky fortress on the mainland, called ""Old Tyre,"" and the city, built on a small, rocky island about half-a-mile distant from the shore. It was a place of great strength. It was besieged by Shalmaneser, who was assisted by the Phoenicians of the mainland, for five years, and by Nebuchadnezzar (B.C. 586-573) for thirteen years, apparently without success. It afterwards fell under the power of Alexander the Great, after a siege of seven months, but continued to maintain much of its commercial importance till the Christian era. It is referred to in  Matthew 11:21   and  Acts 12:20  . In A.D. 1291 it was taken by the Saracens, and has remained a desolate ruin ever since.    ""The purple dye of Tyre had a worldwide celebrity on account of the durability of its beautiful tints, and its manufacture proved a source of abundant wealth to the inhabitants of that city.""   Both Tyre and Sidon ""were crowded with glass-shops, dyeing and weaving establishments; and among their cunning workmen not the least important class were those who were celebrated for the engraving of precious stones."" ( 2 Chronicles 2:7  2 Chronicles 2:14  ).    The wickedness and idolatry of this city are frequently denounced by the prophets, and its final destruction predicted ( Isaiah 23:1  ;  Jeremiah 25:22  ; Ezek. 26;  28:1-19  ;  Amos 1:9  Amos 1:10  ;  Zechariah 9:2-4  ).    Here a church was founded soon after the death of Stephen, and Paul, on his return from his third missionary journey spent a week in intercourse with the disciples there ( Acts 21:4  ). Here the scene at Miletus was repeated on his leaving them. They all, with their wives and children, accompanied him to the sea-shore. The sea-voyage of the apostle terminated at Ptolemais, about 38 miles from Tyre. Thence he proceeded to Caesarea ( Acts 21:5-8  ).    ""It is noticed on monuments as early as B.C. 1500, and claiming, according to Herodotus, to have been founded about B.C. 2700. It had two ports still existing, and was of commercial importance in all ages, with colonies at Carthage (about B.C. 850) and all over the Mediterranean. It was often attacked by Egypt and Assyria, and taken by Alexander the Great after a terrible siege in B.C. 332. It is now a town of 3,000 inhabitants, with ancient tombs and a ruined cathedral. A short Phoenician text of the fourth century B.C. is the only monument yet recovered.""",52,1184,,,"paul_2479, philip_2347, agabus_107, mnason_2102",,"Josh.19.29,2Sam.5.11,2Sam.24.7,1Kgs.5.1,1Kgs.7.13,1Kgs.7.14,1Kgs.9.11,1Kgs.9.12,1Chr.14.1,2Chr.2.3,2Chr.2.11,2Chr.2.14,Ps.45.12,Ps.83.7,Ps.87.4,Isa.23.1,Isa.23.5,Isa.23.8,Isa.23.15,Isa.23.17,Jer.25.22,Jer.27.3,Jer.47.4,Ezek.26.2,Ezek.26.3,Ezek.26.4,Ezek.26.7,Ezek.26.15,Ezek.27.2,Ezek.27.3,Ezek.27.8,Ezek.27.32,Ezek.28.2,Ezek.28.12,Ezek.29.18,Joel.3.4,Amos.1.9,Amos.1.10,Zech.9.2,Zech.9.3,Matt.11.21,Matt.11.22,Matt.15.21,Mark.3.8,Mark.7.24,Mark.7.31,Luke.6.17,Luke.10.13,Luke.10.14,Acts.12.20,Acts.21.3,Acts.21.7",http://dare.ht.lu.se/places/21116,VERIFIED,"circus,settlement",,"Tyrus/Col.

Some, however, think that the name of the city must be connected with the name of the hill behind it, from which one of the finest prospects in Palestine is obtained, and accordingly they derive it from the Hebrew <i> notserah</i> , i.e., one guarding or watching, thus designating the hill which overlooks and thus guards an extensive region.   This city is not mentioned in the Old Testament. It was the home of Joseph and Mary ( Luke 2:39  ), and here the angel announced to the Virgin the birth of the Messiah ( 1:26-28  ). Here Jesus grew up from his infancy to manhood ( 4:16  ); and here he began his public ministry in the synagogue ( Matthew 13:54  ), at which the people were so offended that they sought to cast him down from the precipice whereon their city was built ( Luke 4:29  ). Twice they expelled him from their borders ( 4:16-29  ;  Matthew 13:54-58  ); and he finally retired from the city, where he did not many mighty works because of their unbelief ( Matthew 13:58  ), and took up his residence in Capernaum.    Nazareth is situated among the southern ridges of Lebanon, on the steep slope of a hill, about 14 miles from the Sea of Galilee and about 6 west from Mount Tabor. It is identified with the modern village en-Nazirah, of six or ten thousand inhabitants. It lies ""as in a hollow cup"" lower down upon the hill than the ancient city. The main road for traffic between Egypt and the interior of Asia passed by Nazareth near the foot of Tabor, and thence northward to Damascus.    It is supposed from the words of Nathanael in  John 1:46   that the city of Nazareth was held in great disrepute, either because, it is said, the people of Galilee were a rude and less cultivated class, and were largely influenced by the Gentiles who mingled with them, or because of their lower type of moral and religious character. But there seems to be no sufficient reason for these suppositions. The Jews believed that, according to  Micah 5:2  , the birth of the Messiah would take place at Bethlehem, and nowhere else. Nathanael held the same opinion as his countrymen, and believed that the great ""good"" which they were all expecting could not come from Nazareth. This is probably what Nathanael meant. Moreover, there does not seem to be any evidence that the inhabitants of Galilee were in any respect inferior, or that a Galilean was held in contempt, in the time of our Lord. (See Dr. Merrill's Galilee in the Time of Christ.)    The population of this city (now about 10,000) in the time of Christ probably amounted to 15,000 or 20,000 souls.    ""The so-called 'Holy House' is a cave under the Latin church, which appears to have been originally a tank. The 'brow of the hill', site of the attempted precipitation, is probably the northern cliff: the traditional site has been shown since the middle ages at some distance to the south. None of the traditional sites are traceable very early, and they have no authority. The name Nazareth perhaps means 'a watch tower' (now en-Nasrah), but is connected in the New Testament with Netzer, 'a branch' ( Isaiah 4:2  ;  Jeremiah 23:5  ;  Zechariah 3:8  ;  6:12  ;  Matthew 2:23  ), Nazarene being quite a different word from Nazarite.""",28,878,,,,,"Matt.2.23,Matt.4.13,Matt.21.11,Matt.26.71,Mark.1.9,Mark.1.24,Mark.10.47,Mark.16.6,Luke.1.26,Luke.2.4,Luke.2.39,Luke.2.51,Luke.4.16,Luke.4.34,Luke.18.37,Luke.24.19,John.1.45,John.1.46,John.18.5,John.18.7,John.19.19,Acts.2.22,Acts.3.6,Acts.4.10,Acts.6.14,Acts.10.38,Acts.22.8,Acts.26.9",http://dare.ht.lu.se/places/22899,VERIFIED,settlement,,"Nazareth|Nazareth, Nazareth",1f7f2866-4113-4a79-85aa-9812b95aa99b,Nazareth,2022-03-15 20:57
red_sea_986,publish,Red Sea,,Water,Related-Surrounding,19.0,39.5,water,https://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/eastons-bible-dictionary/red-sea.html," The sea so called extends along the west coast of Arabia for about 1,400 miles, and separates Asia from Africa. It is connected with the Indian Ocean, of which it is an arm, by the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb. At a point (Ras Mohammed) about 200 miles from its nothern extremity it is divided into two arms, that on the east called the AElanitic Gulf, now the Bahr el-'Akabah, about 100 miles long by 15 broad, and that on the west the Gulf of Suez, about 150 miles long by about 20 broad. This branch is now connected with the Mediterranean by the Suez Canal. Between these two arms lies the Sinaitic Peninsula.    The Hebrew name generally given to this sea is <i> Yam Suph</i> . This word <i> suph</i> means a woolly kind of sea-weed, which the sea casts up in great abundance on its shores. In these passages,  Exodus 10:19  ;  13:18  ;  Exodus 15:4  Exodus 15:22  ;  23:31  ;  Numbers 14:25  , etc., the Hebrew name is always translated ""Red Sea,"" which was the name given to it by the Greeks. The origin of this name (Red Sea) is uncertain. Some think it is derived from the red colour of the mountains on the western shore; others from the red coral found in the sea, or the red appearance sometimes given to the water by certain zoophytes floating in it. In the New Testament ( Acts 7:36  ;  Hebrews 11:29  ) this name is given to the Gulf of Suez.    This sea was also called by the Hebrews Yam-mitstraim, i.e., ""the Egyptian sea"" ( Isaiah 11:15  ), and simply Ha-yam, ""the sea"" ( Exodus 14:2  Exodus 14:9  Exodus 14:16  Exodus 14:21  Exodus 14:28  ;  Joshua 24:6  Joshua 24:7  ;  Isaiah 10:26  , etc.).    The great historical event connected with the Red Sea is the passage of the children of Israel, and the overthrow of the Egyptians, to which there is frequent reference in Scripture ( Exodus 1415 ,15;  Numbers 33:8  ;  Deuteronomy 11:4  ;  Joshua 2:10  ;  Judges 11:16  ;  2  Sam  22:16 ;  Nehemiah 9:9-11  ;  Psalms 66:6  ;  Isaiah 10:26  ;  Acts 7:36  , etc.).",26,986,,,,,"Exod.10.19,Exod.13.18,Exod.15.4,Exod.15.22,Exod.23.31,Num.14.25,Num.21.4,Num.33.10,Num.33.11,Deut.1.40,Deut.2.1,Deut.11.4,Josh.2.10,Josh.4.23,Josh.24.6,Judg.11.16,1Kgs.9.26,Neh.9.9,Ps.106.7,Ps.106.9,Ps.106.22,Ps.136.13,Ps.136.15,Jer.49.21,Acts.7.36,Heb.11.29",http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/39290,VERIFIED,water-open,,Arabicus Sinus/Erythr(ae)um/Rubrum Mare,8934a32d-2c7c-45ba-8bc9-0af4dea7c9ca,Red Sea,2020-09-07 19:43

Here they remained encamped for about a whole year. Their journey from the Red Sea to this encampment, including all the windings of the route, was about 150 miles. The last twenty-two chapters of Exodus, together with the whole of Leviticus and Nu ch. 1-11, contain a record of all the transactions which occurred while they were here. From Rephidim ( Exodus 17:8-13  ) the Israelites journeyed forward through the Wady Solaf and Wady esh-Sheikh into the plain of er-Rahah, ""the desert of Sinai,"" about 2 miles long and half a mile broad, and encamped there ""before the mountain."" The part of the mountain range, a protruding lower bluff, known as the Ras Sasafeh (Sufsafeh), rises almost perpendicularly from this plain, and is in all probability the Sinai of history. Dean Stanley thus describes the scene:, ""The plain itself is not broken and uneven and narrowly shut in, like almost all others in the range, but presents a long retiring sweep, within which the people could remove and stand afar off. The cliff, rising like a huge altar in front of the whole congregation, and visible against the sky in lonely grandeur from end to end of the whole plain, is the very image of the 'mount that might be touched,' and from which the voice of God might be heard far and wide over the plain below."" This was the scene of the giving of the law. From the Ras Sufsafeh the law was proclaimed to the people encamped below in the plain of er-Rahah. During the lengthened period of their encampment here the Israelites passed through a very memorable experience. An immense change passed over them. They are now an organized nation, bound by covenant engagement to serve the Lord their God, their ever-present divine Leader and Protector. At length, in the second month of the second year of the Exodus, they move their camp and march forward according to a prescribed order. After three days they reach the ""wilderness of Paran,"" the ""et-Tih"", i.e., ""the desert"", and here they make their first encampment. At this time a spirit of discontent broke out amongst them, and the Lord manifested his displeasure by a fire which fell on the encampment and inflicted injury on them. Moses called the place Taberah (q.v.),  Numbers 11:1-3  . The journey between Sinai and the southern boundary of the Promised Land (about 150 miles) at Kadesh was accomplished in about a year.

It is one of the oldest cities of the world ( Genesis 10:19  ;  Joshua 15:47  ). Its earliest inhabitants were the Avims, who were conquered and displaced by the Caphtorims ( Deuteronomy 2:23  ;  Joshua 13:2  Joshua 13:3  ), a Philistine tribe. In the division of the land it fell to the lot of Judah ( Joshua 15:47  ;  Judges 1:18  ).

ephesus_400,publish,Ephesus,,City,,37.941944,27.339722,,https://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/eastons-bible-dictionary/ephesus.html," the capital of proconsular Asia, which was the western part of Asia Minor. It was colonized principally from Athens. In the time of the Romans it bore the title of ""the first and greatest metropolis of Asia."" It was distinguished for the Temple of Diana (q.v.), who there had her chief shrine; and for its theatre, which was the largest in the world, capable of containing 50,000 spectators. It was, like all ancient theatres, open to the sky. Here were exhibited the fights of wild beasts and of men with beasts. (Compare  1 Corinthians 4:9  ;  1 Corinthians 9:24  1 Corinthians 9:25  ;  15:32  .)    Many Jews took up their residence in this city, and here the seeds of the gospel were sown immediately after Pentecost ( Acts 2:9  ;  6:9  ). At the close of his second missionary journey (about A.D. 51), when Paul was returning from Greece to Syria ( 18:18-21  ), he first visited this city. He remained, however, for only a short time, as he was hastening to keep the feast, probably of Pentecost, at Jerusalem; but he left Aquila and Priscilla behind him to carry on the work of spreading the gospel.    During his third missionary journey Paul reached Ephesus from the ""upper coasts"" ( Acts 19:1  ), i.e., from the inland parts of Asia Minor, and tarried here for about three years; and so successful and abundant were his labours that ""all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks"" ( 19:10  ). Probably during this period the seven churches of the Apocalypse were founded, not by Paul's personal labours, but by missionaries whom he may have sent out from Ephesus, and by the influence of converts returning to their homes.    On his return from his journey, Paul touched at Miletus, some 30 miles south of Ephesus ( Acts 20:15  ), and sending for the presbyters of Ephesus to meet him there, he delivered to them that touching farewell charge which is recorded in  Acts 20:18-35  . Ephesus is not again mentioned till near the close of Paul's life, when he writes to Timothy exhorting him to ""abide still at Ephesus"" ( 1 Timothy 1:3  ).    Two of Paul's companions, Trophimus and Tychicus, were probably natives of Ephesus ( Acts 20:4  ;  21:29  ;  2  Tim  4:12  ). In his second epistle to Timothy, Paul speaks of Onesiphorus as having served him in many things at Ephesus ( 2 Timothy 1:18  ). He also ""sent Tychicus to Ephesus"" ( 4:12  ), probably to attend to the interests of the church there. Ephesus is twice mentioned in the Apocalypse ( 1:11  ;  2:1  ).    The apostle John, according to tradition, spent many years in Ephesus, where he died and was buried.   A part of the site of this once famous city is now occupied by a small Turkish village, Ayasaluk, which is regarded as a corruption of the two Greek words, hagios theologos; i.e., ""the holy divine.""

It was built by Herod the Great (B.C. 10), who named it after Caesar Augustus, hence called Caesarea Sebaste (Gr. Sebastos = ""Augustus""), on the site of an old town called ""Strato's Tower."" It was the capital of the Roman province of Judaea, the seat of the governors or procurators, and the headquarters of the Roman troops. It was the great Gentile city of Palestine, with a spacious artificial harbour. It was adorned with many buildings of great splendour, after the manner of the Roman cities of the West. Here Cornelius the centurion was converted through the instrumentality of Peter ( Acts 10:1  Acts 10:24  ), and thus for the first time the door of faith was opened to the Gentiles. Philip the evangelist resided here with his four daughters ( 21:8  ). From this place Saul sailed for his native Tarsus when forced to flee from Jerusalem ( 9:30  ), and here he landed when returning from his second missionary journey ( 18:22  ). He remained as a prisoner here for two years before his voyage to Rome ( Acts 24:27  ;  Acts 25:1  Acts 25:4  Acts 25:6  Acts 25:13  ). Here on a ""set day,"" when games were celebrated in the theatre in honour of the emperor Claudius, Herod Agrippa I. appeared among the people in great pomp, and in the midst of the idolatrous homage paid to him was suddenly smitten by an angel, and carried out a dying man. He was ""eaten of worms"" ( 12:19-23  ), thus perishing by the same loathsome disease as his granfather, Herod the Great. It still retains its ancient name Kaiseriyeh, but is now desolate.

It is one of the oldest towns in Asia. It was and still is the chief sea-port of Judea. It was never wrested from the Phoenicians. It became a Jewish town only in the second century B.C. It was from this port that Jonah ""took ship to flee from the presence of the Lord"" ( Jonah 1:3  ). To this place also the wood cut in Lebanon by Hiram's men for Solomon was brought in floats ( 2 Chronicles 2:16  ); and here the material for the building of the second temple was also landed ( Ezra 3:7  ).

It is said to have been founded B.C. 753. When the New Testament was written, Rome was enriched and adorned with the spoils of the world, and contained a population estimated at 1,200,000, of which the half were slaves, and including representatives of nearly every nation then known. It was distinguished for its wealth and luxury and profligacy. The empire of which it was the capital had then reached its greatest prosperity.    On the day of Pentecost there were in Jerusalem ""strangers from Rome,"" who doubtless carried with them back to Rome tidings of that great day, and were instrumental in founding the church there. Paul was brought to this city a prisoner, where he remained for two years ( Acts 28:30  Acts 28:31  ) ""in his own hired house."" While here, Paul wrote his epistles to the Philippians, to the Ephesians, to the Colossians, to Philemon, and probably also to the Hebrews. He had during these years for companions Luke and Aristarchus ( Acts 27:2  ), Timothy (Phil  1:1  ;  Colossians 1:1  ), Tychicus ( Ephesians 6:  :  21 ), Epaphroditus (Phil  4:18  ), and John Mark ( Colossians 4:10  ). (See PAUL  .)   Beneath this city are extensive galleries, called ""catacombs,"" which were used from about the time of the apostles (one of the inscriptions found in them bears the date A.D. 71) for some three hundred years as places of refuge in the time of persecution, and also of worship and burial. About four thousand inscriptions have been found in the catacombs. These give an interesting insight into the history of the church at Rome down to the time of Constantine.",9,1013,,,"paul_2479, aristarchus_306, julius_1763","Eph,Phil,Col,Phlm,2Tim","Acts.2.10,Acts.18.2,Acts.19.21,Acts.23.11,Acts.28.14,Acts.28.16,Rom.1.7,Rom.1.15,2Tim.1.17",http://dare.ht.lu.se/places/1438,VERIFIED,"settlement,urban",,"Roma|Roma, Roma|Rome",ca566ff5-f56a-4c84-9b18-63b1eec55b15,Rome,2020-08-28 20:09

It was the capital of one of the four Roman districts of Macedonia, and was ruled by a praetor. It was named after Thessalonica, the wife of Cassander, who built the city. She was so called by her father, Philip, because he first heard of her birth on the day of his gaining a victory over the Thessalians. On his second missionary journey, Paul preached in the synagogue here, the chief synagogue of the Jews in that part of Macedonia, and laid the foundations of a church ( Acts 17:1-4  ;  1 Thessalonians 1:9  ). The violence of the Jews drove him from the city, when he fled to Berea ( Acts 17:5-10  ). The ""rulers of the city"" before whom the Jews ""drew Jason,"" with whom Paul and Silas lodged, are in the original called politarchai, an unusual word, which was found, however, inscribed on an arch in Thessalonica. This discovery confirms the accuracy of the historian. Paul visited the church here on a subsequent occasion ( 20:1-3  ). This city long retained its importance.

corinth_306,publish,Corinth,,City,,37.906045,22.878721,,https://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/eastons-bible-dictionary/corinth.html," a Grecian city, on the isthmus which joins the Peloponnesus to the mainland of Greece. It is about 48 miles west of Athens. The ancient city was destroyed by the Romans (B.C. 146), and that mentioned in the New Testament was quite a new city, having been rebuilt about a century afterwards and peopled by a colony of freedmen from Rome. It became under the Romans the seat of government for Southern Greece or Achaia ( Acts 18:12-16  ). It was noted for its wealth, and for the luxurious and immoral and vicious habits of the people. It had a large mixed population of Romans, Greeks, and Jews. When Paul first visited the city (A.D. 51 or 52), Gallio, the brother of Seneca, was proconsul. Here Paul resided for eighteen months ( 18:1-18  ). Here he first became aquainted with Aquila and Priscilla, and soon after his departure Apollos came to it from Ephesus. After an interval he visited it a second time, and remained for three months ( 20:3  ). During this second visit his Epistle to the Romans was written (probably A.D. 55). Although there were many Jewish converts at Corinth, yet the Gentile element prevailed in the church there.    Some have argued from  2 Corinthians 12:14  ;  13:1  , that Paul visited Corinth a third time (i.e., that on some unrecorded occasion he visited the city between what are usually called the first and second visits). But the passages referred to only indicate Paul's intention to visit Corinth (Compare  1 Corinthians 16:5  , where the Greek present tense denotes an intention), an intention which was in some way frustrated. We can hardly suppose that such a visit could have been made by the apostle without more distinct reference to it.",6,306,,,"paul_2479, timotheus_2863, silas_2740, aquila_279, priscilla_2370, gallio_1275, crispus_961, sosthenes_2772, justus_1766","1Thess,2Thess","Acts.18.1,Acts.19.1,1Cor.1.2,2Cor.1.1,2Cor.1.23,2Tim.4.20",http://dare.ht.lu.se/places/17070,VERIFIED,"sanctuary,settlement,fort",,"Akrokorinthos|Corinthus/Korinthos|Corinthus/Korinthos, Korinthos|Akrokorinthos, Akrokorinthos",575d9b60-cf98-49c4-a437-88e98e3eac12,Corinth,2020-08-27 01:33

It contained latterly a large number of Jews, who were introduced into the city by Ptolemy, the son of Lagus, because he thought they would contribute to the security of the place. They increased in number and influence; and we are thus prepared for the frequent references to them in connection with the early history of Christianity. Simon, who bore our Lord's cross, was a native of this place ( Matthew 27:32  ;  Mark 15:21  ). Jews from Cyrene were in Jerusalem at Pentecost ( Acts 2:10  ); and Cyrenian Jews had a synagogue at Jerusalem ( 6:9  ). Converts belonging to Cyrene contributed to the formation of the first Gentile church at Antioch ( 11:20  ).

They were an intermixture of Gauls and Greeks, and hence were called Gallo-Graeci, and the country Gallo-Graecia. The Galatians were in their origin a part of that great Celtic migration which invaded Macedonia about B.C. 280. They were invited by the king of Bithynia to cross over into Asia Minor to assist him in his wars. There they ultimately settled, and being strengthened by fresh accessions of the same clan from Europe, they overran Bithynia, and supported themselves by plundering neighbouring countries. They were great warriors, and hired themselves out as mercenary soldiers, sometimes fighting on both sides in the great battles of the times. They were at length brought under the power of Rome in B.C. 189, and Galatia became a Roman province B.C. 25.    This province of Galatia, within the limits of which these Celtic tribes were confined, was the central region of Asia Minor.   During his second missionary journey Paul, accompanied by Silas and Timothy ( Acts 16:6  ), visited the ""region of Galatia,"" where he was detained by sickness ( Galatians 4:13  ), and had thus the longer opportunity of preaching to them the gospel. On his third journey he went over ""all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order"" ( Acts 18:23  ).

But soon after, through the influence of the Jews from Antioch in Pisidia and Iconium, they stoned Paul and left him for dead ( 14:19  ).

This name is not found in the Old Testament, and in the New Testament it is mentioned only in the passages above referred to.    ""In the Egyptian inscriptions Phoenicia is called Keft, the inhabitants being Kefa; and since Keft-ur, or 'Greater Phoenicia,' was the name given to the delta of the Nile from the Phoenician colonies settled upon it, the Philistines who came from Caphtor or Keft-ur must have been of Phoenician origin"" (Compare  Deuteronomy 2:23  ;  Jeremiah 47:4  ;  Amos 9:7  )., Sayce's Bible and the Monuments.    Phoenicia lay in the very centre of the old world, and was the natural entrepot for commerce with foreign nations. It was the ""England of antiquity."" ""The trade routes from all Asia converged on the Phoenician coast; the centres of commerce on the Euphrates and Tigris forwarding their goods by way of Tyre to the Nile, to Arabia, and to the west; and, on the other hand, the productions of the vast regions bordering the Mediterranean passing through the Canaanite capital to the eastern world."" It was ""situate at the entry of the sea, a merchant of the people for many isles"" ( Ezekiel 27:3  Ezekiel 27:4  ). The far-reaching commercial activity of the Phoenicians, especially with Tarshish and the western world, enriched them with vast wealth, which introduced boundless luxury and developed among them a great activity in all manner of arts and manufactures. (See TYRE  .)   The Phoenicians were the most enterprising merchants of the old world, establishing colonies at various places, of which Carthage was the chief. They were a Canaanite branch of the race of Ham, and are frequently called Sidonians, from their principal city of Sidon. None could ""skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians"" ( 1 Kings 5:6  ). King Hiram rendered important service to Solomon in connection with the planning and building of the temple, casting for him all the vessels for the temple service, and the two pillars which stood in the front of the porch, and ""the molten sea"" ( 1 Kings 7:21-23  ). Singular marks have been found by recent exploration on the great stones that form the substructure of the temple. These marks, both painted and engraved, have been regarded as made by the workmen in the quarries, and as probably intended to indicate the place of these stones in the building. ""The Biblical account ( 1 Kings 5:17  1 Kings 5:18  ) is accurately descriptive of the massive masonry now existing at the south-eastern angle (of the temple area), and standing on the native rock 80 feet below the present surface. The Royal Engineers found, buried deeply among the rubbish of many centuries, great stones, costly and hewed stones, forming the foundation of the sanctuary wall; while Phoenician fragments of pottery and Phoenician marks painted on the massive blocks seem to proclaim that the stones were prepared in the quarry by the cunning workmen of Hiram, the king of Tyre."" (See TEMPLE  .)   The Phoenicians have been usually regarded as the inventors of alphabetic writing. The Egyptians expressed their thoughts by certain symbols, called ""hieroglyphics"", i.e., sacred carvings, so styled because used almost exclusively on sacred subjects. The recent discovery, however, of inscriptions in Southern Arabia (Yemen and Hadramaut), known as Hemyaritic, in connection with various philogical considerations, has led some to the conclusion that the Phoenician alphabet was derived from the Mineans (admitting the antiquity of the kingdom of Ma'in, Judg.  10:12  ;  2  Chr   26:7  ). Thus the Phoenician alphabet ceases to be the mother alphabet. Sayce thinks ""it is more than possible that the Egyptians themselves were emigrants from Southern Arabia."" (See MOABITE  STONE .)   ""The Phoenicians were renowned in ancient times for the manufacture of glass, and some of the specimens of this work that have been preserved are still the wonder of mankind...In the matter of shipping, whether ship-building be thought of or traffic upon the sea, the Phoenicians surpassed all other nations."" ""The name Phoenicia is of uncertain origin, though it may be derived from Fenkhu, the name given in the Egyptian inscriptions to the natives of Palestine. Among the chief Phoenician cities were Tyre and Sidon, Gebal north of Beirut, Arvad or Arados and Zemar.""
