aaron_1,publish,1,Aaron,,aaron_1,Aaron,,checked,Male,-1574,-1451,egypt_362,mount_hor_842,Tribe of Levi,https://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/eastons-bible-dictionary/aaron.html," the eldest son of Amram and Jochebed, a daughter of Levi (  Exodus 6:20  ). Some explain the name as meaning mountaineer, others mountain of strength, illuminator. He was born in Egypt three years before his brother Moses, and a number of years after his sister Miriam (  Exodus 2:1   Exodus 2:4  ;   7:7  ). He married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab of the house of Judah (  6:23  ;   1�Chronicles 2:10  ), by whom he had four sons, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. When the time for the deliverance of Isarael out of Egypt drew nigh, he was sent by God (  Exodus 4:14   Exodus 4:27-30  ) to meet his long-absent brother, that he might co-operate with him in all that they were required to do in bringing about the Exodus. He was to be the ""mouth"" or ""prophet"" of Moses, i.e., was to speak for him, because he was a man of a ready utterance (  Exodus 7:1   Exodus 7:2   Exodus 7:9   Exodus 7:10   Exodus 7:19  ). He was faithful to his trust, and stood by Moses in all his interviews with Pharaoh.    When the ransomed tribes fought their first battle with Amalek in Rephidim, Moses stood on a hill overlooking the scene of the conflict with the rod of God in his outstretched hand. On this occasion he was attended by Aaron and Hur, his sister's husband, who held up his wearied hands till Joshua and the chosen warriors of Israel gained the victory (  17:8-13  ).    Afterwards, when encamped before Sinai, and when Moses at the command of God ascended the mount to receive the tables of the law, Aaron and his two sons, Nadab and Abihu, along with seventy of the elders of Israel, were permitted to accompany him part of the way, and to behold afar off the manifestation of the glory of Israel's God (  Exodus 19:24  ;   24:9-11  ). While Moses remained on the mountain with God, Aaron returned unto the people; and yielding through fear, or ignorance, or instability of character, to their clamour, made unto them a golden calf, and set it up as an object of worship (  Exodus 32:4  ;   Psalms 106:19  ). On the return of Moses to the camp, Aaron was sternly rebuked by him for the part he had acted in this matter; but he interceded for him before God, who forgave his sin (  Deuteronomy 9:20  ).    On the mount, Moses received instructions regarding the system of worship which was to be set up among the people; and in accordance therewith Aaron and his sons were consecrated to the priest's office (  Leviticus 8  ;   9  ). Aaron, as high priest, held henceforth the prominent place appertaining to that office.    When Israel had reached Hazeroth, in ""the wilderness of Paran,"" Aaron joined with his sister Miriam in murmuring against Moses, ""because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married,"" probably after the death of Zipporah. But the Lord vindicated his servant Moses, and punished Miriam with leprosy (  Numbers 12  ). Aaron acknowledged his own and his sister's guilt, and at the intercession of Moses they were forgiven.    Twenty years after this, when the children of Israel were encamped in the wilderness of Paran, Korah, Dathan, and Abiram conspired against Aaron and his sons; but a fearful judgment from God fell upon them, and they were destroyed, and the next day thousands of the people also perished by a fierce pestilence, the ravages of which were only stayed by the interposition of Aaron (  Numbers 16  ). That there might be further evidence of the divine appointment of Aaron to the priestly office, the chiefs of the tribes were each required to bring to Moses a rod bearing on it the name of his tribe. And these, along with the rod of Aaron for the tribe of Levi, were laid up overnight in the tabernacle, and in the morning it was found that while the other rods remained unchanged, that of Aaron ""for the house of Levi"" budded, blossomed, and yielded almonds (  Numbers 17:1-10  ). This rod was afterwards preserved in the tabernacle (  Hebrews 9:4  ) as a memorial of the divine attestation of his appointment to the priesthood.    Aaron was implicated in the sin of his brother at Meribah (  Numbers 20:8-13  ), and on that account was not permitted to enter the Promised Land. When the tribes arrived at Mount Hor, ""in the edge of the land of Edom,"" at the command of God Moses led Aaron and his son Eleazar to the top of that mountain, in the sight of all the people. There he stripped Aaron of his priestly vestments, and put them upon Eleazar; and there Aaron died on the top of the mount, being 123 years old (  Numbers 20:23-29  . Compare   Deuteronomy 10:6  ;   32:50  ), and was ""gathered unto his people."" The people, ""even all the house of Israel,"" mourned for him thirty days. Of Aaron's sons two survived him, Eleazar, whose family held the high-priesthood till the time of Eli; and Ithamar, in whose family, beginning with Eli, the high-priesthood was held till the time of Solomon. Aaron's other two sons had been struck dead (  Leviticus 10:1   Leviticus 10:2  ) for the daring impiety of offering ""strange fire"" on the alter of incense.    The Arabs still show with veneration the traditionary site of Aaron's grave on one of the two summits of Mount Hor, which is marked by a Mohammedan chapel. His name is mentioned in the Koran, and there are found in the writings of the rabbins many fabulous stories regarding him.   He was the first anointed priest. His descendants, ""the house of Aaron,"" constituted the priesthood in general. In the time of David they were very numerous (  1�Chronicles 12:27  ). The other branches of the tribe of Levi held subordinate positions in connection with the sacred office. Aaron was a type of Christ in his official character as the high priest. His priesthood was a ""shadow of heavenly things,"" and was intended to lead the people of Israel to look forward to the time when ""another priest"" would arise ""after the order of Melchizedek"" (  Hebrews 6:20  ).

Till the age of seventy, Abram sojourned among his kindred in his native country of Chaldea. He then, with his father and his family and household, quitted the city of Ur, in which he had hitherto dwelt, and went some 300 miles north to Haran, where he abode fifteen years. The cause of his migration was a call from God (  Acts 7:2-4  ). There is no mention of this first call in the Old Testament; it is implied, however, in   Genesis 12  . While they tarried at Haran, Terah died at the age of 205 years. Abram now received a second and more definite call, accompanied by a promise from God (  Genesis 12:1   Genesis 12:2  ); whereupon he took his departure, taking his nephew Lot with him, ""not knowing whither he went"" (  Hebrews 11:8  ). He trusted implicitly to the guidance of Him who had called him.    Abram now, with a large household of probably a thousand souls, entered on a migratory life, and dwelt in tents. Passing along the valley of the Jabbok, in the land of Canaan, he formed his first encampment at Sichem (  Genesis 12:6  ), in the vale or oak-grove of Moreh, between Ebal on the north and Gerizim on the south. Here he received the great promise, ""I will make of thee a great nation,"" etc. (  Genesis 12:2   Genesis 12:3   Genesis 12:7  ). This promise comprehended not only temporal but also spiritual blessings. It implied that he was the chosen ancestor of the great Deliverer whose coming had been long ago predicted (  Genesis 3:15  ). Soon after this, for some reason not mentioned, he removed his tent to the mountain district between Bethel, then called Luz, and Ai, towns about two miles apart, where he built an altar to ""Jehovah."" He again moved into the southern tract of Palestine, called by the Hebrews the Negeb; and was at length, on account of a famine, compelled to go down into Egypt. This took place in the time of the Hyksos, a Semitic race which now held the Egyptians in bondage. Here occurred that case of deception on the part of Abram which exposed him to the rebuke of Pharaoh (  Genesis 12:18  ). Sarai was restored to him; and Pharaoh loaded him with presents, recommending him to withdraw from the country. He returned to Canaan richer than when he left it, ""in cattle, in silver, and in gold"" (  Genesis 12:8  ;   13:2  . Compare   Psalms 105:13   Psalms 105:14  ). The whole party then moved northward, and returned to their previous station near Bethel. Here disputes arose between Lot's shepherds and those of Abram about water and pasturage. Abram generously gave Lot his choice of the pasture-ground. (Compare   1�Corinthians 6:7  .) He chose the well-watered plain in which Sodom was situated, and removed thither; and thus the uncle and nephew were separated. Immediately after this Abram was cheered by a repetition of the promises already made to him, and then removed to the plain or ""oak-grove"" of Mamre, which is in Hebron. He finally settled here, pitching his tent under a famous oak or terebinth tree, called ""the oak of Mamre"" (  Genesis 13:18  ). This was his third resting-place in the land.    Some fourteen years before this, while Abram was still in Chaldea, Palestine had been invaded by Chedorlaomer, King of Elam, who brought under tribute to him the five cities in the plain to which Lot had removed. This tribute was felt by the inhabitants of these cities to be a heavy burden, and after twelve years they revolted. This brought upon them the vengeance of Chedorlaomer, who had in league with him four other kings. He ravaged the whole country, plundering the towns, and carrying the inhabitants away as slaves. Among those thus treated was Lot. Hearing of the disaster that had fallen on his nephew, Abram immediately gathered from his own household a band of 318 armed men, and being joined by the Amoritish chiefs Mamre, Aner, and Eshcol, he pursued after Chedorlaomer, and overtook him near the springs of the Jordan. They attacked and routed his army, and pursued it over the range of Anti-Libanus as far as to Hobah, near Damascus, and then returned, bringing back all the spoils that had been carried away. Returning by way of Salem, i.e., Jerusalem, the king of that place, Melchizedek, came forth to meet them with refreshments. To him Abram presented a tenth of the spoils, in recognition of his character as a priest of the most high God (  Genesis 14:18-20  ).    In a recently-discovered tablet, dated in the reign of the grandfather of Amraphel (  Genesis 14:1  ), one of the witnesses is called ""the Amorite, the son of Abiramu,"" or Abram.    Having returned to his home at Mamre, the promises already made to him by God were repeated and enlarged (  Genesis 13:14  ). ""The word of the Lord"" (an expression occurring here for the first time) ""came to him"" (  15:1  ). He now understood better the future that lay before the nation that was to spring from him. Sarai, now seventy-five years old, in her impatience, persuaded Abram to take Hagar, her Egyptian maid, as a concubine, intending that whatever child might be born should be reckoned as her own. Ishmael was accordingly thus brought up, and was regarded as the heir of these promises (  Genesis 16  ). When Ishmael was thirteen years old, God again revealed yet more explicitly and fully his gracious purpose; and in token of the sure fulfilment of that purpose the patriarch's name was now changed from Abram to Abraham (  Genesis 17:4   Genesis 17:5  ), and the rite of circumcision was instituted as a sign of the covenant. It was then announced that the heir to these covenant promises would be the son of Sarai, though she was now ninety years old; and it was directed that his name should be Isaac. At the same time, in commemoration of the promises, Sarai's name was changed to Sarah. On that memorable day of God's thus revealing his design, Abraham and his son Ishmael and all the males of his house were circumcised (  Genesis 17  ). Three months after this, as Abraham sat in his tent door, he saw three men approaching. They accepted his proffered hospitality, and, seated under an oak-tree, partook of the fare which Abraham and Sarah provided. One of the three visitants was none other than the Lord, and the other two were angels in the guise of men. The Lord renewed on this occasion his promise of a son by Sarah, who was rebuked for her unbelief. Abraham accompanied the three as they proceeded on their journey. The two angels went on toward Sodom; while the Lord tarried behind and talked with Abraham, making known to him the destruction that was about to fall on that guilty city. The patriarch interceded earnestly in behalf of the doomed city. But as not even ten righteous persons were found in it, for whose sake the city would have been spared, the threatened destruction fell upon it; and early next morning Abraham saw the smoke of the fire that consumed it as the ""smoke of a furnace"" (  Genesis 19:1-28  ).    After fifteen years' residence at Mamre, Abraham moved southward, and pitched his tent among the Philistines, near to Gerar. Here occurred that sad instance of prevarication on his part in his relation to Abimelech the King (  Genesis 20  ). (See  ABIMELECH ) Soon after this event, the patriarch left the vicinity of Gerar, and moved down the fertile valley about 25 miles to Beer-sheba. It was probably here that Isaac was born, Abraham being now an hundred years old. A feeling of jealousy now arose between Sarah and Hagar, whose son, Ishmael, was no longer to be regarded as Abraham's heir. Sarah insisted that both Hagar and her son should be sent away. This was done, although it was a hard trial to Abraham (  Genesis 21:12  ). (See HAGAR;  ISHMAEL.)   At this point there is a blank in the patriarch's history of perhaps twenty-five years. These years of peace and happiness were spent at Beer-sheba. The next time we see him his faith is put to a severe test by the command that suddenly came to him to go and offer up Isaac, the heir of all the promises, as a sacrifice on one of the mountains of Moriah. His faith stood the test (  Hebrews 11:17-19  ). He proceeded in a spirit of unhesitating obedience to carry out the command; and when about to slay his son, whom he had laid on the altar, his uplifted hand was arrested by the angel of Jehovah, and a ram, which was entangled in a thicket near at hand, was seized and offered in his stead. From this circumstance that place was called Jehovah-jireh, i.e., ""The Lord will provide."" The promises made to Abraham were again confirmed (and this was the last recorded word of God to the patriarch); and he descended the mount with his son, and returned to his home at Beer-sheba (  Genesis 22:19  ), where he resided for some years, and then moved northward to Hebron.    Some years after this Sarah died at Hebron, being 127 years old. Abraham acquired now the needful possession of a burying-place, the cave of Machpelah, by purchase from the owner of it, Ephron the Hittite (  Genesis 23  ); and there he buried Sarah. His next care was to provide a wife for Isaac, and for this purpose he sent his steward, Eliezer, to Haran (or Charran,   Acts 7:2  ), where his brother Nahor and his family resided (  Genesis 11:31  ). The result was that Rebekah, the daughter of Nahor's son Bethuel, became the wife of Isaac (  Genesis 24  ). Abraham then himself took to wife Keturah, who became the mother of six sons, whose descendants were afterwards known as the ""children of the east"" (  Judges 6:3  ), and later as ""Saracens."" At length all his wanderings came to an end.

He was so enraged at Paul's noble declaration, ""I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day,"" that he commanded one of his attendants to smite him on the mouth. Smarting under this unprovoked insult, Paul quickly replied, ""God shall smite thee, thou whited wall."" Being reminded that Ananias was the high priest, to whose office all respect was to be paid, he answered, ""I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest"" (  Acts 23:5  ). This expression has occasioned some difficulty, as it is scarcely probable that Paul should have been ignorant of so public a fact. The expression may mean (a) that Paul had at the moment overlooked the honour due to the high priest; or (b), as others think, that Paul spoke ironically, as if he had said, ""The high priest breaking the law! God's high priest a tyrant and a lawbreaker! I see a man in white robes, and have heard his voice, but surely it cannot, it ought not to be, the voice of the high priest."" (See Dr. Lindsay on Acts, <i> in loco</i> .) (c) Others think that from defect of sight Paul could not observe that the speaker was the high priest. In all this, however, it may be explained, Paul, with all his excellency, comes short of the example of his divine Master, who, when he was reviled, reviled not again.","Paul goes before the Council, Paul sent to Felix",,2,"Acts.23.2,Acts.24.1",,,,,,,,Ananias 3

By common agreement the members of the early Christian community devoted their property to the work of furthering the gospel and of assisting the poor and needy. The proceeds of the possessions they sold were placed at the disposal of the apostles (  Acts 4:36   Acts 4:37  ). Ananias might have kept his property had he so chosen; but he professed agreement with the brethren in the common purpose, and had of his own accord devoted it all, as he said, to these sacred ends. Yet he retained a part of it for his own ends, and thus lied in declaring that he had given it all. ""The offence of Ananias and Sapphira showed contempt of God, vanity and ambition in the offenders, and utter disregard of the corruption which they were bringing into the society.

He was of Bethsaida in Galilee (  John 1:44  ), and was the brother of Simon Peter (  Matthew 4:18  ;   10:2  ). On one occasion John the Baptist, whose disciple he then was, pointing to Jesus, said, ""Behold the Lamb of God"" (  John 1:40  ); and Andrew, hearing him, immediately became a follower of Jesus, the first of his disciples. After he had been led to recognize Jesus as the Messiah, his first care was to bring also his brother Simon to Jesus. The two brothers seem to have after this pursued for a while their usual calling as fishermen, and did not become the stated attendants of the Lord till after John's imprisonment (  Matthew 4:18   Matthew 4:19  ;   Mark 1:16   Mark 1:17  ). Very little is related of Andrew. He was one of the confidential disciples (  John 6:8  ;   12:22  ), and with Peter, James, and John inquired of our Lord privately regarding his future coming (  Mark 13:3  ). He was present at the feeding of the five thousand (  John 6:9  ), and he introduced the Greeks who desired to see Jesus (  John 12:22  ); but of his subsequent history little is known.

By the Mosaic law the high-priesthood was held for life (  Numbers 3:10  ); and although Annas had been deposed by the Roman procurator, the Jews may still have regarded him as legally the high priest. Our Lord was first brought before Annas, and after a brief questioning of him (  John 18:19-23  ) was sent to Caiaphas, when some members of the Sanhedrim had met, and the first trial of Jesus took place (  Matthew 26:57-68  ).

His name stands first on the list of prophets and teachers of the church at Antioch (  13:1  ). Luke speaks of him as a ""good man"" (  11:24  ). He was born of Jewish parents of the tribe of Levi. He was a native of Cyprus, where he had a possession of land (  Acts 4:36   Acts 4:37  ), which he sold. His personal appearance is supposed to have been dignified and commanding (  Acts 14:11   Acts 14:12  ). When Paul returned to Jerusalem after his conversion, Barnabas took him and introduced him to the apostles (  9:27  ). They had probably been companions as students in the school of Gamaliel.    The prosperity of the church at Antioch led the apostles and brethren at Jerusalem to send Barnabas thither to superintend the movement. He found the work so extensive and weighty that he went to Tarsus in search of Saul to assist him. Saul returned with him to Antioch and laboured with him for a whole year (  Acts 11:25   Acts 11:26  ). The two were at the end of this period sent up to Jerusalem with the contributions the church at Antioch had made for the poorer brethren there (  11:28-30  ). Shortly after they returned, bringing John Mark with them, they were appointed as missionaries to the heathen world, and in this capacity visited Cyprus and some of the principal cities of Asia Minor (  Acts 13:14  ). Returning from this first missionary journey to Antioch, they were again sent up to Jerusalem to consult with the church there regarding the relation of Gentiles to the church (  Acts 15:2  :   Galatians 2:1  ). This matter having been settled, they returned again to Antioch, bringing the decree of the council as the rule by which Gentiles were to be admitted into the church.    When about to set forth on a second missionary journey, a dispute arose between Saul and Barnabas as to the propriety of taking John Mark with them again. The dispute ended by Saul and Barnabas taking separate routes. Saul took Silas as his companion, and journeyed through Syria and Cilicia; while Barnabas took his nephew John Mark, and visited Cyprus (  Acts 15:36-41  ). Barnabas is not again mentioned by Luke in the Acts.","Believers share all things, Saul proclaims Jesus, Disciples first called Christians, First missionary journey begins, Barnabas and Saul go to Cyprus, Mission to Antioch in Pisidia, Mission to Lystra and Derbe, Jerusalem Council, Paul and Barnabas part ways, Mission to Iconium, Return to Antioch in Syria",,29,"Acts.4.36,Acts.9.27,Acts.11.22,Acts.11.25,Acts.11.30,Acts.12.25,Acts.13.1,Acts.13.2,Acts.13.7,Acts.13.43,Acts.13.46,Acts.13.50,Acts.14.12,Acts.14.13,Acts.14.14,Acts.14.20,Acts.15.2,Acts.15.12,Acts.15.22,Acts.15.25,Acts.15.35,Acts.15.36,Acts.15.37,Acts.15.39,1Cor.9.6,Gal.2.1,Gal.2.9,Gal.2.13,Col.4.10",,,,mary_1941,,,,Barnabas

The younger son of Jacob by Rachel (  Genesis 35:18  ). His birth took place at Ephrath, on the road between Bethel and Bethlehem, at a short distance from the latter place. His mother died in giving him birth, and with her last breath named him Ben-oni, son of my pain, a name which was changed by his father into Benjamin. His posterity are called Benjamites (  Genesis 49:27  ;   Deuteronomy 33:12  ;   Joshua 18:21  ).    The tribe of Benjamin at the Exodus was the smallest but one (  Numbers 1:36   Numbers 1:37  ;   Psalms 68:27  ). During the march its place was along with Manasseh and Ephraim on the west of the tabernacle. At the entrance into Canaan it counted 45,600 warriors. It has been inferred by some from the words of Jacob (  Genesis 49:27  ) that the figure of a wolf was on the tribal standard. This tribe is mentioned in   Romans 11:1  ; Phil   3:5  .    The inheritance of this tribe lay immediately to the south of that of Ephraim, and was about 26 miles in length and 12 in breadth. Its eastern boundary was the Jordan. Dan intervened between it and the Philistines. Its chief towns are named in   Joshua 18:21-28  .    The history of the tribe contains a sad record of a desolating civil war in which they were engaged with the other eleven tribes. By it they were almost exterminated (  Judges 20:20   Judges 20:21  ;   21:10  ). (See  GIBEAH  .)   The first king of the Jews was Saul, a Benjamite. A close alliance was formed between this tribe and that of Judah in the time of David (  2 Samuel 19:16   2 Samuel 19:17  ), which continued after his death (  1�Kings 11:13  ;   12:20  ). After the Exile these two tribes formed the great body of the Jewish nation (  Ezra 1:5  ;   10:9  ).    The tribe of Benjamin was famous for its archers (  1 Samuel 20:20   1 Samuel 20:36  ;   2  Sam   1:22  ;   1�Chronicles 8:40  ;   12:2  ) and slingers (Judge.   20:6  ).    The gate of Benjamin, on the north side of Jerusalem (  Jeremiah 37:13  ;   38:7  ;   Zechariah 14:10  ), was so called because it led in the direction of the territory of the tribe of Benjamin. It is called by (  Jeremiah 20:2  ) ""the high gate of Benjamin;"" also ""the gate of the children of the people"" (  17:19  ).

He held this office during the whole of Pilate's administration. His wife was the daughter of Annas, who had formerly been high priest, and was probably the vicar or deputy (Heb. sagan) of Caiaphas. He was of the sect of the Sadducees (  Acts 5:17  ), and was a member of the council when he gave his opinion that Jesus should be put to death ""for the people, and that the whole nation perish not"" (  John 11:50  ). In these words he unconsciously uttered a prophecy. ""Like Saul, he was a prophet in spite of himself."" Caiaphas had no power to inflict the punishment of death, and therefore Jesus was sent to Pilate, the Roman governor, that he might duly pronounce the sentence against him (  Matthew 27:2  ;   John 18:28  ).

It was long the centre of commercial intercourse between Africa and the south of Asia, and hence became famous for its wealth (  Isaiah 45:14  ).    It is somewhat singular that female sovereignty seems to have prevailed in Ethiopia, the name Candace (compare ""Pharaoh,"" ""Ptolemy,"" ""Caesar"") being a title common to several successive queens. It is probable that Judaism had taken root in Ethiopia at this time, and hence the visit of the queen's treasurer to Jerusalem to keep the feast. There is a tradition that Candace was herself converted to Christianity by her treasurer on his return, and that he became the apostle of Christianity in that whole region, carrying it also into Abyssinia.

His father seems to have been a man in humble life. His mother's name is not recorded. Some think she was the Nahash of   2�Samuel 17:25  . As to his personal appearance, we only know that he was red-haired, with beautiful eyes and a fair face (  1�Samuel 16:12  ;   17:42  ).    His early occupation was that of tending his father's sheep on the uplands of Judah. From what we know of his after history, doubtless he frequently beguiled his time, when thus engaged, with his shepherd's flute, while he drank in the many lessons taught him by the varied scenes spread around him. His first recorded exploits were his encounters with the wild beasts of the field. He mentions that with his own unaided hand he slew a lion and also a bear, when they came out against his flock, beating them to death in open conflict with his club (  1 Samuel 17:34   1 Samuel 17:35  ).    While David, in the freshness of ruddy youth, was thus engaged with his flocks, Samuel paid an unexpected visit to Bethlehem, having been guided thither by divine direction (  1�Samuel 16:1-13  ). There he offered up sacrifice, and called the elders of Israel and Jesse's family to the sacrificial meal. Among all who appeared before him he failed to discover the one he sought. David was sent for, and the prophet immediately recognized him as the chosen of God, chosen to succeed Saul, who was now departing from the ways of God, on the throne of the kingdom. He accordingly, in anticipation, poured on his head the anointing oil. David went back again to his shepherd life, but ""the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward,"" and ""the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul"" (  1 Samuel 16:13   1 Samuel 16:14  ).    Not long after this David was sent for to soothe with his harp the troubled spirit of Saul, who suffered from a strange melancholy dejection. He played before the king so skilfully that Saul was greatly cheered, and began to entertain great affection for the young shepherd. After this he went home to Bethlehem. But he soon again came into prominence. The armies of the Philistines and of Israel were in battle array in the valley of Elah, some 16 miles south-west of Bethlehem; and David was sent by his father with provisions for his three brothers, who were then fighting on the side of the king. On his arrival in the camp of Israel, David (now about twenty years of age) was made aware of the state of matters when the champion of the Philistines, Goliath of Gath, came forth to defy Israel. David took his sling, and with a well-trained aim threw a stone ""out of the brook,"" which struck the giant's forehead, so that he fell senseless to the ground. David then ran and slew him, and cut off his head with his own sword (  1�Samuel 17  ). The result was a great victory to the Israelites, who pursued the Philistines to the gates of Gath and Ekron.    David's popularity consequent on this heroic exploit awakened Saul's jealousy (  1�Samuel 18:6-16  ), which he showed in various ways. He conceived a bitter hatred toward him, and by various stratagems sought his death ( 1�Samuel 1830 -30). The deep-laid plots of the enraged king, who could not fail to observe that David ""prospered exceedingly,"" all proved futile, and only endeared the young hero the more to the people, and very specially to Jonathan, Saul's son, between whom and David a life-long warm friendship was formed.    A fugitive. To escape from the vengeance of Saul, David fled to Ramah (  1�Samuel 19:12-18  ) to Samuel, who received him, and he dwelt among the sons of the prophets, who were there under Samuel's training. It is supposed by some that the sixth, seventh, and eleventh Psalms were composed by him at this time. This place was only 3 miles from the residence of Saul, who soon discovered whither the fugitive had gone, and tried ineffectually to bring him back. Jonathan made a fruitless effort to bring his father to a better state of mind toward David (  1�Samuel 20  ), who, being made aware of the fact, saw no hope of safety but in flight to a distance. We accordingly find him first at Nob (  21:1-9  ) and then at Gath, the chief city of the Philistines. The king of the Philistines would not admit him into his service, as he expected that he would, and David accordingly now betook himself to the stronghold of Adullam (  22:1-4  ;   1�Chronicles 12:8-18  ). Here in a short time 400 men gathered around him and acknowledged him as their leader. It was at this time that David, amid the harassment and perils of his position, cried, ""Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem;"" when three of his heroes broke through the lines of the Philistines and brought him the water for which he longed (  2�Samuel 23:13-17  ), but which he would not drink.    In his rage at the failure of all his efforts to seize David, Saul gave orders for the massacre of the entire priestly family at Nob, ""persons who wore a linen ephod"", to the number of eighty-five persons, who were put to death by Doeg the Edomite. The sad tidings of the massacre were brought to David by Abiathar, a son of Ahimelech, the only one who escaped. Compare   Psalms 52  .    Hearing that Keilah, a town on the western frontier, was harassed by the Philistines, David with his men relieved it (  1�Samuel 23:1-14  ); and then, for fear of Saul, he fled to the strongholds in the ""hill country"" of Judah. Compare   Psalms 31  . While encamped there, in the forest in the district of Ziph, he was visited by Jonathan, who spoke to him words of encouragement ( 23:16-18 ). The two now parted never to meet again. Saul continued his pursuit of David, who narrowly escaped from him at this time, and fled to the crags and ravines of Engedi, on the western shore of the Dead Sea (  1�Samuel 23:29  ). Here Saul, who still pursued him with his army, narrowly escaped, through the generous forbearance of David, and was greatly affected by what David had done for him. He returned home from pursuing him, and David betook himself to Maon, where, with his 600 men, he maintained himself by contributions gathered from the district. Here occurred the incident connected with Nabal and his wife Abigail (  1�Samuel 25  ), whom David married after Nabal's death.    Saul again went forth (  1�Samuel 26  ) in pursuit of David, who had hid himself ""in the hill Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon,"" in the wilderness of Ziph, and was a second time spared through his forbearance. He returned home, professing shame and penitence for the way in which he had treated David, and predicting his elevation to the throne.    Fighting against Israel. Harassed by the necessity of moving from place to place through fear of Saul, David once more sought refuge among the Philistines (  1�Samuel 27  ). He was welcomed by the king, who assigned him Ziklag as his residence. Here David lived among his followers for some time as an independent chief engaged in frequent war with the Amalekites and other tribes on the south of Judah.    Achish summoned David with his men to join his army against Saul; but the lords of the Philistines were suspicious of David's loyalty, and therefore he was sent back to Ziklag, which he found to his dismay may had been pillaged and burnt during his brief absence. David pursued after the raiders, the Amalekites, and completely routed them. On his return to Ziklag tidings reached him of Saul's death (2Sam. 1). An Amalekite brought Saul's crown and bracelet and laid them at his feet. David and his men rent their clothes and mourned for Saul, who had been defeated in battle near Mount Gilboa. David composed a beautiful elegy, the most beautiful of all extant Hebrew odes, a ""lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son"" (  2�Samuel 1:18-27  ). It bore the title of ""The Bow,"" and was to be taught to the children, that the memory of Saul and Jonathan might be preserved among them. ""Behold, it is written in the book of Jasher"" (q.v.).    David king over Judah. David and his men now set out for Hebron under divine direction (  2�Samuel 2:1-4  ). There they were cordially welcomed, and he was at once anointed as king. He was now about thirty years of age.    But his title to the throne was not undisputed. Abner took Ish-bosheth, Saul's only remaining son, over the Jordan to Mahanaim, and there crowned him as king. Then began a civil war in Israel. The first encounter between the two opposing armies, led on the one side by Abner, and on the other by Joab, took place at the pool of Gibeon. It resulted in the defeat of Abner. Other encounters, however, between Israel and Judah followed (  2 Samuel 3:1   2 Samuel 3:5  ), but still success was on the side of David. For the space of seven and a half years David reigned in Hebron. Abner now sided with David, and sought to promote his advancement; but was treacherously put to death by Joab in revenge for his having slain his brother Asahel at Gibeon (  3:22-39  ). This was greatly to David's regret. He mourned for the death of Abner. Shortly after this Ish-bosheth was also treacherously put to death by two Canaanites of Beeroth; and there being now no rival, David was anointed king over all Israel (  4:1-12  ).    David king over all Israel (  2�Samuel 5:1-5  ;   1�Chronicles 11:1-3  ). The elders of Israel now repaired to Hebron and offered allegiance to David in name of all the people, among whom the greatest enthusiasm prevailed. He was anointed king over all Israel, and sought out a new seat of government, more suitable than Hebron, as the capital of his empire. At this time there was a Jebusite fortress, ""the stronghold"", on the hill of Zion, called also Jebus. This David took from the Jebusites, and made it Israel's capital, and established here his residence, and afterwards built for himself a palace by the aid of Tyrian tradesmen. The Philistines, who had for some time observed a kind of truce, now made war against David; but were defeated in battle at a place afterwards called, in remembrance of the victory, Baal-perazim. Again they invaded the land, and were a second time routed by him. He thus delivered Israel from their enemies.    David now resolved to bring up the ark of the covenant to his new capital (  2�Samuel 6  ). It was in the house of Abinadab at Kirjath-jearim, about 7 miles from Jerusalem, where it had been for many years, from the time when the Philistines had sent it home (  1�Samuel 6  ;   7  ). In consequence of the death of Uzzah (for it was a divine ordinance that only the Levites should handle the ark,   Numbers 4  ), who had put forth his hand to steady the ark when the cart in which it was being conveyed shook by reason of the roughness of the road, David stayed the procession, and conveyed the ark into the house of Obed-edom, a Philistine from Gath. After three months David brought the ark from the house of Obed-edom up to Jerusalem. Compare   Psalms 24  . Here it was placed in a new tent or tabernacle which David erected for the purpose. About seventy years had passed since it had stood in the tabernacle at Shiloh. The old tabernacle was now at Gibeah, at which Zadok ministered. David now (  1�Chronicles 16  ) carefully set in order all the ritual of divine worship at Jerusalem, along with Abiathar the high priest. A new religious era began. The service of praise was for the first time introduced into public worship. Zion became henceforth ""God's holy hill.""    David's wars. David now entered on a series of conquests which greatly extended and strengthened his kingdom (  2�Samuel 8  ). In a few years the whole territory from the Euphrates to the river of Egypt, and from Gaza on the west to Thapsacus on the east, was under his sway (  2�Samuel 8:3-13  ;   10  ).    David's fall. He had now reached the height of his glory. He ruled over a vast empire, and his capital was enriched with the spoils of many lands. But in the midst of all this success he fell, and his character became stained with the sin of adultery (  2�Samuel 11:2-27  ). It has been noted as characteristic of the Bible that while his military triumphs are recorded in a few verses, the sad story of his fall is given in detail, a story full of warning, and therefore recorded. This crime, in the attempt to conceal it, led to anoter. He was guilty of murder. Uriah, whom he had foully wronged, an officer of the Gibborim, the corps of heros (  23:39  ), was, by his order, ""set in the front of the hottest battle"" at the siege of Rabbah, in order that he might be put to death. Nathan the prophet (  2�Samuel 7:1-17  ;   12:1-23  ) was sent by God to bring home his crimes to the conscience of the guilty monarch. He became a true penitent. He bitterly bewailed his sins before God. The thirty-second and fifty-first Psalms reveal the deep struggles of his soul, and his spiritual recovery.    Bathsheba became his wife after Uriah's death. Her first-born son died, according to the word of the prophet. She gave birth to a second son, whom David called Solomon, and who ultimately succeeded him on the throne (  2 Samuel 12:24   2 Samuel 12:25  ).    Peace. After the successful termination of all his wars, David formed the idea of building a temple for the ark of God. This he was not permitted to carry into execution, because he had been a man of war. God, however, sent Nathan to him with a gracious message (  2�Samuel 7:1-16  ). On receiving it he went into the sanctuary, the tent where the ark was, and sat before the Lord, and poured out his heart in words of devout thanksgiving (18-29). The building of the temple was reserved for his son Solomon, who would be a man of peace (  1�Chronicles 22:9  ;   28:3  ).    A cloudy evening. Hitherto David's carrer had been one of great prosperity and success. Now cloudy and dark days came. His eldest son Amnon, whose mother was Ahinoam of Jezreel, was guilty of a great and shameful crime (  2�Samuel 13  ). This was the beginning of the disasters of his later years. After two years Absalom terribly avenged the crime against Tamar, and put Amnon to death. This brought sore trouble to David's heart. Absalom, afraid of the consequences of his guilt, fled to Geshur beyond Jordan, where he remained for three years, when he was brought back through the intrigue of Joab (  2�Samuel 14  ).    After this there fell upon the land the calamity of three years' famine (  2�Samuel 21:1-14  ). This was soon after followed by a pestilence, brought upon the land as a punishment for David's sinful pride in numbering the people (  2�Samuel 24  ), in which no fewer than 70,000 perished in the space of three days.    Rebellion of Absalom. The personal respect for David was sadly lowered by the incident of Bathsheba. There was a strong popular sentiment against the taking of the census, and the outburst of the plague in connection with it deepened the feeling of jealously that had begun to manifest itself among some of the tribes against David. Absalom, taking full advantage of this state of things, gradually gained over the people, and at length openly rebelled against his father, and usurped the throne. Ahithophel was Absalom's chief counsellor. The revolt began in Hebron, the capital of Judah. Absalom was there proclaimed king. David was now in imminent danger, and he left Jerusalem (  2�Samuel 15:13-20  ), and once more became a fugitive. It was a momentous day in Israel. The incidents of it are recorded with a fulness of detail greater than of any other day in Old Testament history. David fled with his followers to Mahanarm, on the east of Jordan. An unnatural civil war broke out. After a few weeks the rival armies were mustered and organized. They met in hostile array at the wood of Ephraim (  2�Samuel 18:1-8  ). Absalom's army was defeated, and himself put to death by the hand of Joab (9-18). The tidings of the death of his rebellious son filled the heart of David with the most poignant grief. He ""went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept"" (33), giving utterance to the heart-broken cry, ""Would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!"" Peace was now restored, and David returned to Jerusalem and resumed the direction of affairs. An unhappy dispute arose between the men of Judah and the men of Israel (  19:41-43  ). Sheba, a Benjamite, headed a revolt of the men of Israel. He was pursued to Abelbeth-maachah, and was there put to death, and so the revolt came to an end.    The end. After the suppression of the rebellion of Absalom and that of Sheba, ten comparatively peaceful years of David's life passed away. During those years he seems to have been principally engaged in accumulating treasures of every kind for the great temple at Jerusalem, which it was reserved to his successor to build (  1�Chronicles 22  ;   28  ;   29  ), a house which was to be ""exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries"" (  22:5  ). The exciting and laborious life he had spent, and the dangers and trials through which he had passed, had left him an enfeebled man, prematurely old. It became apparent that his life was now drawing to its close. A new palace conspiracy broke out as to who should be his successor. Joab favoured Adonijah. The chiefs of his party met at the ""Fuller's spring,"" in the valley of Kidron, to proclaim him king; but Nathan hastened on a decision on the part of David in favour of Solomon, and so the aim of Adonijah's party failed. Solomon was brought to Jerusalem, and was anointed king and seated on his father's throne (  1�Kings 1:11-53  ). David's last words are a grand utterance, revealing his unfailing faith in God, and his joyful confidence in his gracious covenant promises (  2�Samuel 23:1-7  ).    After a reign of forty years and six months (  2�Samuel 5:5  ;   1�Chronicles 3:4  ) David died (B.C. 1015) at the age of seventy years, ""and was buried in the city of David."" His tomb is still pointed out on Mount Zion.    Both in his prophetical and in his regal character David was a type of the Messiah (  1�Samuel 16:13  ). The book of Psalms commonly bears the title of the ""Psalms of David,"" from the circumstance that he was the largest contributor (about eighty psalms) to the collection. (See  PSALMS  .)   ""The greatness of David was felt when he was gone. He had lived in harmony with both the priesthood and the prophets; a sure sign that the spirit of his government had been throughly loyal to the higher aims of the theocracy. The nation had not been oppressed by him, but had been left in the free enjoyment of its ancient liberties. As far as his power went he had striven to act justly to all (  2�Samuel 8:15  ). His weak indulgence to his sons, and his own great sin besides, had been bitterly atoned, and were forgotten at his death in the remembrance of his long-tried worth. He had reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem and seven and a half at Hebron (  2�Samuel 5:5  ). Israel at his accession had reached the lowest point of national depression; its new-born unity rudely dissolved; its territory assailed by the Philistines. But he had left it an imperial power, with dominions like those of Egypt or Assyria.

At the end of a two years' term, Porcius Festus was appointed in the room of Felix (A.D. 60), who proceeded to Rome, and was there accused of cruelty and malversation of office by the Jews of Caesarea. The accusation was rendered nugatory by the influence of his brother Pallas with Nero. (See Josephus, Ant. xx. 8,9.)    Drusilla, the daughter of Herod Agrippa, having been induced by Felix to desert her husband, the king of Emesa, became his adulterous companion.

Gud; Ger. Gott), the name of the Divine Being. It is the rendering (1) of the Hebrew <i> 'El</i> , from a word meaning to be strong; (2) of <i> 'Eloah_, plural _'Elohim</i> . The singular form, <i> Eloah</i> , is used only in poetry. The plural form is more commonly used in all parts of the Bible, The Hebrew word Jehovah (q.v.), the only other word generally employed to denote the Supreme Being, is uniformly rendered in the Authorized Version by ""LORD,"" printed in small capitals. The existence of God is taken for granted in the Bible. There is nowhere any argument to prove it. He who disbelieves this truth is spoken of as one devoid of understanding (  Psalms 14:1  ).    The arguments generally adduced by theologians in proof of the being of God are:   <li> The a priori argument, which is the testimony afforded by reason.    <li> The a posteriori argument, by which we proceed logically from the facts of experience to causes. These arguments are,    (a) The cosmological, by which it is proved that there must be a First Cause of all things, for every effect must have a cause.   (b) The teleological, or the argument from design. We see everywhere the operations of an intelligent Cause in nature.   (c) The moral argument, called also the anthropological argument, based on the moral consciousness and the history of mankind, which exhibits a moral order and purpose which can only be explained on the supposition of the existence of God. Conscience and human history testify that ""verily there is a God that judgeth in the earth.""   The attributes of God are set forth in order by Moses in   Exodus 34:6   Exodus 34:7  . (see also   Deuteronomy 6:4  ;   10:17  ;   Numbers 16:22  ;   Exodus 15:11  ;   33:19  ;   Isaiah 44:6  ;   Habakkuk 3:6  ;   Psalms 102:26  ;   Job 34:12  .) They are also systematically classified in   Revelation 5:12   and   7:12  .    God's attributes are spoken of by some as absolute, i.e., such as belong to his essence as Jehovah, Jah, etc.; and relative, i.e., such as are ascribed to him with relation to his creatures. Others distinguish them into communicable, i.e., those which can be imparted in degree to his creatures: goodness, holiness, wisdom, etc.; and incommunicable, which cannot be so imparted: independence, immutability, immensity, and eternity. They are by some also divided into natural attributes, eternity, immensity, etc.; and moral, holiness, goodness, etc.","The Holy Spirit comes, Believers pray for boldness, Ananias and Sapphira lie to

He was made tetrarch of the provinces formerly held by Lysanias II., and ultimately possessed the entire kingdom of his grandfather, Herod the Great, with the title of king. He put the apostle James the elder to death, and cast Peter into prison (  Luke 3:1  ;   Acts 12:1-19  ). On the second day of a festival held in honour of the emperor Claudius, he appeared in the great theatre of Caesarea. ""The king came in clothed in magnificent robes, of which silver was the costly brilliant material. It was early in the day, and the sun's rays fell on the king, so that the eyes of the beholders were dazzled with the brightness which surrounded him. Voices here and there from the crowd exclaimed that it was the apparition of something divine. And when he spoke and made an oration to them, they gave a shout, saying, 'It is the voice of a god, and not of a man.' But in the midst of this idolatrous ostentation an angel of God suddenly smote him. He was carried out of the theatre a dying man."" He died (A.D. 44) of the same loathsome malady which slew his grandfather (  Acts 12:21-23  ), in the fifty-fourth year of his age, having reigned four years as tetrarch and three as king over the whole of Palestine. After his death his kingdom came under the control of the prefect of Syria, and Palestine was now fully incorporated with the empire.","Herod kills James, An angel rescues Peter from prison, Herod dies, Herod imprisons Peter",,6,"Acts.12.1,Acts.12.6,Acts.12.11,Acts.12.19,Acts.12.20,Acts.12.21",,,,,,,,Herod Agrippa I.

He reproves, helps, glorifies, intercedes (  John 16:7-13  ;   Romans 8:26  ). (2) He executes the offices peculiar only to a person.

His divinity is established (1) from the fact that the names of God are ascribed to him (  Exodus 17:7  ;   Psalms 95:7  ; Compare   Hebrews 3:7-11  ); and (2) that divine attributes are also ascribed to him, omnipresence (  Psalms 139:7  ;   Ephesians 2:17   Ephesians 2:18  ;   1�Corinthians 12:13  ); omniscience (  1 Corinthians 2:10   1 Corinthians 2:11  ); omnipotence (  Luke 1:35  ;   Romans 8:11  ); eternity (  Hebrews 9:4  ). (3) Creation is ascribed to him (  Genesis 1:2  ;   Job 26:13  ;   Psalms 104:30  ), and the working of miracles (  Matthew 12:28  ;   1�Corinthians 12:9-11  ).

(1) Israel, or the kingdom of the ten tribes (  Amos 7:9   Amos 7:16  ).    The only son of Abraham by Sarah. He was the longest lived of the three patriarchs (  Genesis 21:1-3  ). He was circumcised when eight days old (4-7); and when he was probably two years old a great feast was held in connection with his being weaned.    The next memorable event in his life is that connected with the command of God given to Abraham to offer him up as a sacrifice on a mountain in the land of Moriah (  Genesis 22  ). (See  ABRAHAM  .) When he was forty years of age Rebekah was chosen for his wife (  Genesis 24  ). After the death and burial of his father he took up his residence at Beer-lahai-roi (  25:7-11  ), where his two sons, Esau and Jacob, were born (21-26), the former of whom seems to have been his favourite son (27,28).    In consequence of a famine (  Genesis 26:1  ) Isaac went to Gerar, where he practised deception as to his relation to Rebekah, imitating the conduct of his father in Egypt (  12:12-20  ) and in Gerar (  20:2  ). The Philistine king rebuked him for his prevarication.    After sojourning for some time in the land of the Philistines, he returned to Beersheba, where God gave him fresh assurance of covenant blessing, and where Abimelech entered into a covenant of peace with him.   The next chief event in his life was the blessing of his sons (  Genesis 27:1  ). He died at Mamre, ""being old and full of days"" (  35:27-29  ), one hundred and eighty years old, and was buried in the cave of Machpelah.    In the New Testament reference is made to his having been ""offered up"" by his father (  Hebrews 11:17  ;   James 2:21  ), and to his blessing his sons (  Hebrews 11:20  ). As the child of promise, he is contrasted with Ishmael (  Romans 9:7   Romans 9:10  ;   Galatians 4:28  ;   Hebrews 11:18  ).    Isaac is ""at once a counterpart of his father in simple devoutness and purity of life, and a contrast in his passive weakness of character, which in part, at least, may have sprung from his relations to his mother and wife. After the expulsion of Ishmael and Hagar, Isaac had no competitor, and grew up in the shade of Sarah's tent, moulded into feminine softness by habitual submission to her strong, loving will."" His life was so quiet and uneventful that it was spent ""within the circle of a few miles; so guileless that he let Jacob overreach him rather than disbelieve his assurance; so tender that his mother's death was the poignant sorrow of years; so patient and gentle that peace with his neighbours was dearer than even such a coveted possession as a well of living water dug by his own men; so grandly obedient that he put his life at his father's disposal; so firm in his reliance on God that his greatest concern through life was to honour the divine promise given to his race."", Geikie's Hours, etc.",,,123,"Gen.17.19,Gen.17.21,Gen.21.3,Gen.21.4,Gen.21.5,Gen.21.8,Gen.21.10,Gen.21.12,Gen.22.2,Gen.22.3,Gen.22.6,Gen.22.7,Gen.22.9,Gen.24.4,Gen.24.14,Gen.24.62,Gen.24.63,Gen.24.64,Gen.24.66,Gen.24.67,Gen.25.5,Gen.25.6,Gen.25.9,Gen.25.11,Gen.25.19,Gen.25.20,Gen.25.21,Gen.25.26,Gen.25.28,Gen.26.1,Gen.26.6,Gen.26.8,Gen.26.9,Gen.26.12,Gen.26.16,Gen.26.17,Gen.26.18,Gen.26.19,Gen.26.20,Gen.26.25,Gen.26.27,Gen.26.31,Gen.26.32,Gen.26.35,Gen.27.1,Gen.27.5,Gen.27.20,Gen.27.21,Gen.27.22,Gen.27.26,Gen.27.30,Gen.27.32,Gen.27.33,Gen.27.37,Gen.27.39,Gen.27.46,Gen.28.1,Gen.28.5,Gen.28.6,Gen.28.8,Gen.28.13,Gen.31.18,Gen.31.42,Gen.31.53,Gen.32.9,Gen.35.12,Gen.35.27,Gen.35.28,Gen.35.29,Gen.46.1,Gen.48.15,Gen.48.16,Gen.49.31,Gen.50.24,Exod.2.24,Exod.3.6,Exod.3.15,Exod.3.16,Exod.4.5,Exod.6.3,Exod.6.8,Exod.32.13,Exod.33.1,Lev.26.42,Num.32.11,Deut.1.8,Deut.6.10,Deut.9.5,Deut.9.27,Deut.29.13,Deut.30.20,Deut.34.4,Josh.24.3,Josh.24.4,1Kgs.18.36,2Kgs.13.23,1Chr.1.28,1Chr.1.34,1Chr.16.16,1Chr.29.18,2Chr.30.6,Ps.105.9,Jer.33.26,Amos.7.9,Amos.7.16,Matt.1.2,Matt.8.11,Matt.22.32,Mark.12.26,Luke.3.34,Luke.13.28,Luke.20.37,Acts.3.13,Acts.7.8,Acts.7.32,Rom.9.7,Rom.9.10,Gal.4.28,Heb.11.9,Heb.11.17,Heb.11.18,Heb.11.20,Jas.2.21",sarah_2473,abraham_58,"esau_1216,israel_682",,,"ishbak_620,ishmael_630,jokshan_1685,medan_1978,midian_2075,shuah_2727,zimran_3086",,Isaac 1
isaiah_617,publish,617,Isaiah,Esaias,isaiah_617,Isaiah,,checked,Male,,,,,,https://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/eastons-bible-dictionary/isaiah.html," (Heb. Yesh'yahu, i.e., ""the salvation of Jehovah""). The son of Amoz (  Isaiah 1:1  ;   2:1  ), who was apparently a man of humble rank. His wife was called ""the prophetess"" (  8:3  ), either because she was endowed with the prophetic gift, like Deborah (Judg.   4:4  ) and Huldah (  2�Kings 22:14-20  ), or simply because she was the wife of ""the prophet"" (  Isaiah 38:1  ). He had two sons, who bore symbolical names.    He exercised the functions of his office during the reigns of Uzziah (or Azariah), Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah (  1:1  ). Uzziah reigned fifty-two years (B.C. 810-759), and Isaiah must have begun his career a few years before Uzziah's death, probably B.C. 762. He lived till the fourteenth year of Hezekiah, and in all likelihood outlived that monarch (who died B.C. 698), and may have been contemporary for some years with Manasseh. Thus Isaiah may have prophesied for the long period of at least sixty-four years.    His first call to the prophetical office is not recorded. A second call came to him ""in the year that King Uzziah died"" (  Isaiah 6:1  ). He exercised his ministry in a spirit of uncompromising firmness and boldness in regard to all that bore on the interests of religion. He conceals nothing and keeps nothing back from fear of man. He was also noted for his spirituality and for his deep-toned reverence toward ""the holy One of Israel.""    In early youth Isaiah must have been moved by the invasion of Israel by the Assyrian monarch Pul (q.v.),   2�Kings 15:19  ; and again, twenty years later, when he had already entered on his office, by the invasion of Tiglath-pileser and his career of conquest. Ahaz, king of Judah, at this crisis refused to co-operate with the kings of Israel and Syria in opposition to the Assyrians, and was on that account attacked and defeated by Rezin of Damascus and Pekah of Samaria (  2�Kings 16:5  ;   2  Chr.  2 Kings 28:5  2 Kings 28:6 ). Ahaz, thus humbled, sided with Assyria, and sought the aid of Tiglath-pileser against Israel and Syria. The consequence was that Rezin and Pekah were conquered and many of the people carried captive to Assyria (  2�Kings 15:29  ;   16:9  ;   1�Chronicles 5:26  ). Soon after this Shalmaneser determined wholly to subdue the kingdom of Israel. Samaria was taken and destroyed (B.C. 722). So long as Ahaz reigned, the kingdom of Judah was unmolested by the Assyrian power; but on his accession to the throne, Hezekiah (B.C. 726), who ""rebelled against the king of Assyria"" (  2�Kings 18:7  ), in which he was encouraged by Isaiah, who exhorted the people to place all their dependence on Jehovah (  Isaiah 10:24  ;   37:6  ), entered into an alliance with the king of Egypt (  Isaiah 30:2-4  ). This led the king of Assyria to threaten the king of Judah, and at length to invade the land. Sennacherib (B.C. 701) led a powerful army into Palestine. Hezekiah was reduced to despair, and submitted to the Assyrians (  2�Kings 18:14-16  ). But after a brief interval war broke out again, and again Sennacherib (q.v.) led an army into Palestine, one detachment of which threatened Jerusalem (  Isaiah 36:2-22  ;   37:8  ). Isaiah on that occasion encouraged Hezekiah to resist the Assyrians (  37:1-7  ), whereupon Sennacherib sent a threatening letter to Hezekiah, which he ""spread before the Lord"" (  37:14  ). The judgement of God now fell on the Assyrian host. ""Like Xerxes in Greece, Sennacherib never recovered from the shock of the disaster in Judah. He made no more expeditions against either Southern Palestine or Egypt."" The remaining years of Hezekiah's reign were peaceful (  2 Chronicles 32:23   2 Chronicles 32:27-29  ). Isaiah probably lived to its close, and possibly into the reign of Manasseh, but the time and manner of his death are unknown. There is a tradition that he suffered martyrdom in the heathen reaction in the time of Manasseh (q.v.).

(See  JACOB  .) This is the common name given to Jacob's descendants. The whole people of the twelve tribes are called ""Israelites,"" the ""children of Israel"" (  Joshua 3:17  ;   7:25  ;   Judges 8:27  ;   Jeremiah 3:21  ), and the ""house of Israel"" (  Exodus 16:31  ;   40:38  ).    This name Israel is sometimes used emphatically for the true Israel (  Psalms 73:1  :   Isaiah 45:17  ;   49:3  ;   John 1:47  ;   Romans 9:6  ;   11:26  ).    After the death of Saul the ten tribes arrogated to themselves this name, as if they were the whole nation (  2 Samuel 2:9   2 Samuel 2:10   2 Samuel 2:17   2 Samuel 2:28  ;   2 Samuel 3:10   2 Samuel 3:17  ;   19:40-43  ), and the kings of the ten tribes were called ""kings of Israel,"" while the kings of the two tribes were called ""kings of Judah.""

It denotes that he was anointed or consecrated to his great redemptive work as Prophet, Priest, and King of his people. He is Jesus the Christ (  Acts 17:3  ;   18:5  ;   Matthew 22:42  ), the Anointed One. He is thus spoken of by (  Isaiah 61:1  ), and by (  Daniel 9:24-26  ), who styles him ""Messiah the Prince.""    The Messiah is the same person as ""the seed of the woman"" (  Genesis 3:15  ), ""the seed of Abraham"" (  Genesis 22:18  ), the ""Prophet like unto Moses"" (  Deuteronomy 18:15  ), ""the priest after the order of Melchizedek"" (  Psalms 110:4  ), ""the rod out of the stem of Jesse"" (  Isaiah 11:1    Isaiah 11:10  ), the ""Immanuel,"" the virgin's son (  Isaiah 7:14  ), ""the branch of Jehovah"" (  Isaiah 4:2  ), and ""the messenger of the covenant"" (  Malachi 3:1  ). This is he ""of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write."" The Old Testament Scripture is full of prophetic declarations regarding the Great Deliverer and the work he was to accomplish. Jesus the Christ is Jesus the Great Deliverer, the Anointed One, the Saviour of men. This name denotes that Jesus was divinely appointed, commissioned, and accredited as the Saviour of men (  Hebrews 5:4  ;   Isaiah 11:2-4  ;   49:6  ;   John 5:37  ;   Acts 2:22  ).    To believe that ""Jesus is the Christ"" is to believe that he is the Anointed, the Messiah of the prophets, the Saviour sent of God, that he was, in a word, what he claimed to be. This is to believe the gospel, by the faith of which alone men can be brought unto God. That Jesus is the Christ is the testimony of God, and the faith of this constitutes a Christian (  1&nbsp;Corinthians 12:3  ;   1&nbsp;John 5:1  ).","Jesus ascends to Heaven, The Holy Spirit is

He was one, probably the younger, of the sons of Zebedee (  Matthew 4:21  ) and Salome (  Matthew 27:56  ; Compare   Mark 15:40  ), and was born at Bethsaida. His father was apparently a man of some wealth (Compare   Mark 1:20  ;   Luke 5:3  ;   John 19:27  ). He was doubtless trained in all that constituted the ordinary education of Jewish youth. When he grew up he followed the occupation of a fisherman on the Lake of Galilee. When John the Baptist began his ministry in the wilderness of Judea, John, with many others, gathered round him, and was deeply influenced by his teaching. There he heard the announcement, ""Behold the Lamb of God,"" and forthwith, on the invitation of Jesus, became a disciple and ranked among his followers (  John 1:36   John 1:37  ) for a time. He and his brother then returned to their former avocation, for how long is uncertain. Jesus again called them (  Matthew 4:  :   21  ;   Luke 5:1-11  ), and now they left all and permanently attached themselves to the company of his disciples. He became one of the innermost circle (  Mark 5:37  ;   Matthew 17:1  ;   26:37  ;   Mark 13:3  ). He was the disciple whom Jesus loved. In zeal and intensity of character he was a ""Boanerges"" (  Mark 3:17  ). This spirit once and again broke out (  Matthew 20:20-24  ;   Mark 10:35-41  ;   Luke 9:49   Luke 9:54  ). At the betrayal he and Peter follow Christ afar off, while the others betake themselves to hasty flight (  John 18:15  ). At the trial he follows Christ into the council chamber, and thence to the praetorium (  John 18:16   John 18:19   John 18:28  ) and to the place of crucifixion (  John 19:26   John 19:27  ). To him and Peter, Mary first conveys tidings of the resurrection (  20:2  ), and they are the first to go and see what her strange words mean. After the resurrection he and Peter again return to the Sea of Galilee, where the Lord reveals himself to them (  John 21:1   John 21:7  ). We find Peter and John frequently after this together (  Acts 3:1  ;   4:13  ). John remained apparently in Jerusalem as the leader of the church there (  Acts 15:6  ;   Galatians 2:9  ). His subsequent history is unrecorded. He was not there, however, at the time of Paul's last visit (  Acts 21:15-40  ). He appears to have retired to Ephesus, but at what time is unknown. The seven churches of Asia were the objects of his special care (  Revelation 1:11  ). He suffered under persecution, and was banished to Patmos (  1:9  ); whence he again returned to Ephesus, where he died, probably about A.D. 98, having outlived all or nearly all the friends and companions even of his maturer years. There are many interesting traditions regarding John during his residence at Ephesus, but these cannot claim the character of historical truth.","Matthias replaces Judas, Lame man healed, Peter and John's Trial, Philip preaches in Samaria",,35,"Matt.4.21,Matt.10.2,Matt.17.1,Mark.1.19,Mark.1.29,Mark.3.17,Mark.5.37,Mark.9.2,Mark.9.38,Mark.10.35,Mark.10.41,Mark.13.3,Mark.14.33,Luke.5.10,Luke.6.14,Luke.8.51,Luke.9.28,Luke.9.49,Luke.9.54,Luke.22.8,Acts.1.13,Acts.3.1,Acts.3.3,Acts.3.4,Acts.3.11,Acts.4.13,Acts.4.19,Acts.8.14,Acts.12.2,Gal.2.9,Rev.1.1,Rev.1.4,Rev.1.9,Rev.21.2,Rev.22.8",mother_of_zebedees_children_2112,zebedee_2998,,james_717,,,"John.1,John.2,John.3,John.4,John.5,John.6,John.7,John.8,John.9,John.10,John.11,John.12,John.13,John.14,John.15,John.16,John.17,John.18,John.19,John.20,John.21,1John.1,1John.2,1John.3,1John.4,1John.5,2John.1,3John.1,Rev.1,Rev.2,Rev.3,Rev.4,Rev.5,Rev.6,Rev.7,Rev.8,Rev.9,Rev.10,Rev.11,Rev.12,Rev.13,Rev.14,Rev.15,Rev.16,Rev.17,Rev.18,Rev.19,Rev.20,Rev.21,Rev.22",John 3

We have but fragmentary and imperfect accounts of him in the Gospels. He was of priestly descent. His father, Zacharias, was a priest of the course of Abia (  1&nbsp;Chronicles 24:10  ), and his mother, Elisabeth, was of the daughters of Aaron (  Luke 1:5  ). The mission of John was the subject of prophecy (  Matthew 3:3  ;   Isaiah 40:3  ;   Malachi 3:1  ). His birth, which took place six months before that of Jesus, was foretold by an angel. Zacharias, deprived of the power of speech as a token of God's truth and a reproof of his own incredulity with reference to the birth of his son, had the power of speech restored to him on the occasion of his circumcision (  Luke 1:64  ). After this no more is recorded of him for thirty years than what is mentioned in   Luke 1:80  . John was a Nazarite from his birth (  Luke 1:15  ;   Numbers 6:1-12  ). He spent his early years in the mountainous tract of Judah lying between Jerusalem and the Dead Sea (  Matthew 3:1-12  ).    At length he came forth into public life, and great multitudes from ""every quarter"" were attracted to him. The sum of his preaching was the necessity of repentance. He denounced the Sadducees and Pharisees as a ""generation of vipers,"" and warned them of the folly of trusting to external privileges (  Luke 3:8  ). ""As a preacher, John was eminently practical and discriminating. Self-love and covetousness were the prevalent sins of the people at large. On them, therefore, he enjoined charity and consideration for others. The publicans he cautioned against extortion, the soldiers against crime and plunder."" His doctrine and manner of life roused the entire south of Palestine, and the people from all parts flocked to the place where he was, on the banks of the Jordan. There he baptized thousands unto repentance.    The fame of John reached the ears of Jesus in Nazareth (  Matthew 3:5  ), and he came from Galilee to Jordan to be baptized of John, on the special ground that it became him to ""fulfil all righteousness"" (  3:15  ). John's special office ceased with the baptism of Jesus, who must now ""increase"" as the King come to his kingdom. He continued, however, for a while to bear testimony to the Messiahship of Jesus. He pointed him out to his disciples, saying, ""Behold the Lamb of God."" His public ministry was suddenly (after about six months probably) brought to a close by his being cast into prison by Herod, whom he had reproved for the sin of having taken to himself the wife of his brother Philip (  Luke 3:19  ). He was shut up in the castle of Machaerus (q.v.), a fortress on the southern extremity of Peraea, 9 miles east of the Dead Sea, and here he was beheaded. His disciples, having consigned the headless body to the grave, went and told Jesus all that had occurred (  Matthew 14:3-12  ). John's death occurred apparently just before the third Passover of our Lord's ministry. Our Lord himself testified regarding him that he was a ""burning and a shining light"" (  John 5:35  ).</p></p></p>",,,89,"Matt.3.1,Matt.3.4,Matt.3.13,Matt.3.14,Matt.4.12,Matt.9.14,Matt.11.2,Matt.11.4,Matt.11.7,Matt.11.11,Matt.11.12,Matt.11.13,Matt.11.18,Matt.14.2,Matt.14.3,Matt.14.4,Matt.14.8,Matt.14.10,Matt.16.14,Matt.17.13,Matt.21.25,Matt.21.26,Matt.21.32,Mark.1.4,Mark.1.6,Mark.1.9,Mark.1.14,Mark.2.18,Mark.6.14,Mark.6.16,Mark.6.17,Mark.6.18,Mark.6.20,Mark.6.24,Mark.6.25,Mark.8.28,Mark.11.30,Mark.11.32,Luke.1.13,Luke.1.60,Luke.1.63,Luke.3.2,Luke.3.15,Luke.3.16,Luke.3.20,Luke.5.33,Luke.7.18,Luke.7.19,Luke.7.20,Luke.7.22,Luke.7.24,Luke.7.28,Luke.7.29,Luke.7.33,Luke.9.7,Luke.9.9,Luke.9.19,Luke.11.1,Luke.16.16,Luke.20.4,Luke.20.6,John.1.6,John.1.15,John.1.19,John.1.26,John.1.28,John.1.29,John.1.32,John.1.35,John.1.40,John.3.23,John.3.24,John.3.25,John.3.26,John.3.27,John.4.1,John.5.33,John.5.36,John.10.40,John.10.41,Acts.1.5,Acts.1.22,Acts.10.37,Acts.11.16,Acts.13.24,Acts.13.25,Acts.18.25,Acts.19.3,Acts.19.4",elisabeth_1152,zacharias_2971,,,,,,John the Baptist

The elder of the two sons of Jacob by Rachel (  Genesis 30:23   Genesis 30:24  ), who, on the occasion of his birth, said, ""God hath taken away [Heb. 'asaph] my reproach."" ""The Lord shall add [Heb. yoseph] to me another son"" (  Genesis 30:24  ). He was a child of probably six years of age when his father returned from Haran to Canaan and took up his residence in the old patriarchal town of Hebron. ""Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age,"" and he ""made him a long garment with sleeves"" (  Genesis 37:3  , RSV marg.), i.e., a garment long and full, such as was worn by the children of nobles. This seems to be the correct rendering of the words. The phrase, however, may also be rendered, ""a coat of many pieces"", i.e., a patchwork of many small pieces of divers colours.    When he was about seventeen years old Joseph incurred the jealous hatred of his brothers (  Genesis 37:4  ). They ""hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him."" Their anger was increased when he told them his dreams (  37:11  ).    Jacob desiring to hear tidings of his sons, who had gone to Shechem with their flocks, some 60 miles from Hebron, sent Joseph as his messenger to make inquiry regarding them. Joseph found that they had left Shechem for Dothan, whither he followed them. As soon as they saw him coming they began to plot against him, and would have killed him had not Reuben interposed. They ultimately sold him to a company of Ishmaelite merchants for twenty pieces (shekels) of silver (about $2,10s.), ten pieces less than the current value of a slave, for ""they cared little what they had for him, if so be they were rid of him."" These merchants were going down with a varied assortment of merchandise to the Egyptian market, and thither they conveyed him, and ultimately sold him as a slave to Potiphar, an ""officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard"" (  Genesis 37:36  ). ""The Lord blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake,"" and Potiphar made him overseer over his house. At length a false charge having been brought against him by Potiphar's wife, he was at once cast into the state prison (39; 40), where he remained for at least two years. After a while the ""chief of the cupbearers"" and the ""chief of the bakers"" of Pharaoh's household were cast into the same prison (  40:2  ). Each of these new prisoners dreamed a dream in the same night, which Joseph interpreted, the event occurring as he had said.    This led to Joseph's being remembered subsequently by the chief butler when Pharaoh also dreamed. At his suggestion Joseph was brought from prison to interpret the king's dreams. Pharaoh was well pleased with Joseph's wisdom in interpreting his dreams, and with his counsel with reference to the events then predicted; and he set him over all the land of Egypt (  Genesis 41:46  ), and gave him the name of Zaphnath-paaneah. He was married to Asenath, the daughter of the priest of On, and thus became a member of the priestly class. Joseph was now about thirty years of age.    As Joseph had interpreted, seven years of plenty came, during which he stored up great abundance of corn in granaries built for the purpose. These years were followed by seven years of famine ""over all the face of the earth,"" when ""all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy corn"" (  Genesis 41:56   Genesis 41:57  ;   Genesis 47:13   Genesis 47:14  ). Thus ""Joseph gathered up all the money that was in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought."" Afterwards all the cattle and all the land, and at last the Egyptians themselves, became the property of Pharaoh.    During this period of famine Joseph's brethren also came down to Egypt to buy corn. The history of his dealings with them, and of the manner in which he at length made himself known to them, is one of the most interesting narratives that can be read ( Genesis 4245 -45). Joseph directed his brethren to return and bring Jacob and his family to the land of Egypt, saying, ""I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land. Regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land is yours."" Accordingly Jacob and his family, to the number of threescore and ten souls, together with ""all that they had,"" went down to Egypt. They were settled in the land of Goshen, where Joseph met his father, and ""fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while"" (  Genesis 46:29  ).    The excavations of Dr. Naville have shown the land of Goshen to be the Wady Tumilat, between Ismailia and Zagazig. In Goshen (Egyptian Qosem) they had pasture for their flocks, were near the Asiatic frontier of Egypt, and were out of the way of the Egyptian people. An inscription speaks of it as a district given up to the wandering shepherds of Asia.   Jacob at length died, and in fulfilment of a promise which he had exacted, Joseph went up to Canaan to bury his father in ""the field of Ephron the Hittite"" (  Genesis 47:29-31  ;   50:1-14  ). This was the last recorded act of Joseph, who again returned to Egypt.    ""The 'Story of the Two Brothers,' an Egyptian romance written for the son of the Pharaoh of the Oppression, contains an episode very similar to the Biblical account of Joseph's treatment by Potiphar's wife. Potiphar and Potipherah are the Egyptian Pa-tu-pa-Ra, 'the gift of the sun-god.' The name given to Joseph, Zaphnath-paaneah, is probably the Egyptian Zaf-nti-pa-ankh, 'nourisher of the living one,' i.e., of the Pharaoh. There are many instances in the inscriptions of foreigners in Egypt receiving Egyptian names, and rising to the highest offices of state.""   By his wife Asenath, Joseph had two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim (  Genesis 41:50  ). Joseph having obtained a promise from his brethren that when the time should come that God would ""bring them unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob,"" they would carry up his bones out of Egypt, at length died, at the age of one hundred and ten years; and ""they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin"" (  Genesis 50:26  ). This promise was faithfully observed. Their descendants, long after, when the Exodus came, carried the body about with them during their forty years' wanderings, and at length buried it in Shechem, in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor (  Joshua 24:32  ; Compare   Genesis 33:19  ). With the death of Joseph the patriarchal age of the history of Israel came to a close.    The Pharaoh of Joseph's elevation was probably Apepi, or Apopis, the last of the Hyksos kings. Some, however, think that Joseph came to Egypt in the reign of Thothmes III. (see PHARAOH), long after the expulsion of the Hyksos.   The name Joseph denotes the two tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh in   Deuteronomy 33:13-17  ; the kingdom of Israel in   Ezekiel 37:16   Ezekiel 37:19  ,   Amos 5:6  ; and the whole covenant people of Israel in   Psalms 81:4  .

The son of Nun, of the tribe of Ephraim, the successor of Moses as the leader of Israel. He is called Jehoshua in   Numbers 13:16   (A.V.), and Jesus in   Acts 7:45   and   Hebrews 4:8   (RSV, Joshua).    He was born in Egypt, and was probably of the age of Caleb, with whom he is generally associated. He shared in all the events of the Exodus, and held the place of commander of the host of the Israelites at their great battle against the Amalekites in Rephidim (  Exodus 17:8-16  ). He became Moses' minister or servant, and accompanied him part of the way when he ascended Mount Sinai to receive the two tables (  Exodus 32:17  ). He was also one of the twelve who were sent on by Moses to explore the land of Canaan (  Numbers 13:16   Numbers 13:17  ), and only he and Caleb gave an encouraging report. Under the direction of God, Moses, before his death, invested Joshua in a public and solemn manner with authority over the people as his successor (  Deuteronomy 31:23  ). The people were encamped at Shittim when he assumed the command (  Joshua 1:1  ); and crossing the Jordan, they encamped at Gilgal, where, having circumcised the people, he kept the Passover, and was visited by the Captain of the Lord's host, who spoke to him encouraging words (  1:1-9  ).    Now began the wars of conquest which Joshua carried on for many years, the record of which is in the book which bears his name. Six nations and thirty-one kings were conquered by him (  Joshua 11:18-23  ;   12:24  ). Having thus subdued the Canaanites, Joshua divided the land among the tribes, Timnath-serah in Mount Ephraim being assigned to himself as his own inheritance. (See SHILOH;  PRIEST .)   His work being done, he died, at the age of one hundred and ten years, twenty-five years after having crossed the Jordan. He was buried in his own city of Timnath-serah (  Joshua 24  ); and ""the light of Israel for the time faded away.""    Joshua has been regarded as a type of Christ (  Hebrews 4:8  ) in the following particulars: (1) In the name common to both; (2) Joshua brings the people into the possession of the Promised Land, as Jesus brings his people to the heavenly Canaan; and (3) as Joshua succeeded Moses, so the Gospel succeeds the Law.    The character of Joshua is thus well sketched by Edersheim:, ""Born a slave in Egypt, he must have been about forty years old at the time of the Exodus. Attached to the person of Moses, he led Israel in the first decisive battle against Amalek (  Exodus 17:9   Exodus 17:13  ), while Moses in the prayer of faith held up to heaven the God-given 'rod.' It was no doubt on that occasion that his name was changed from Oshea, 'help,' to Jehoshua, 'Jehovah is help' (  Numbers 13:16  ). And this name is the key to his life and work. Alike in bringing the people into Canaan, in his wars, and in the distribution of the land among the tribes, from the miraculous crossing of Jordan and taking of Jericho to his last address, he was the embodiment of his new name, 'Jehovah is help.'

His name is uniformly the last in the list of the apostles, as given in the synoptic (i.e., the first three) Gospels. The evil of his nature probably gradually unfolded itself till ""Satan entered into him"" (  John 13:27  ), and he betrayed our Lord (  18:3  ). Afterwards he owned his sin with ""an exceeding bitter cry,"" and cast the money he had received as the wages of his iniquity down on the floor of the sanctuary, and ""departed and went and hanged himself"" (  Matthew 27:5  ). He perished in his guilt, and ""went unto his own place"" (  Acts 1:25  ). The statement in   Acts 1:18   that he ""fell headlong and burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out,"" is in no way contrary to that in   Matthew 27:5  . The sucide first hanged himself, perhaps over the valley of Hinnom, ""and the rope giving way, or the branch to which he hung breaking, he fell down headlong on his face, and was crushed and mangled on the rocky pavement below.""    Why such a man was chosen to be an apostle we know not, but it is written that ""Jesus knew from the beginning who should betray him"" (  John 6:64  ). Nor can any answer be satisfactorily given to the question as to the motives that led Judas to betray his Master. ""Of the motives that have been assigned we need not care to fix on any one as that which simply led him on. Crime is, for the most part, the result of a hundred motives rushing with bewildering fury through the mind of the criminal.""

The wife of Joseph, the mother of Jesus, called the ""Virgin Mary,"" though never so designated in Scripture (  Matthew 2:11  ;   Acts 1:14  ). Little is known of her personal history. Her genealogy is given in   Luke 3  . She was of the tribe of Judah and the lineage of David (  Psalms 132:11  ;   Luke 1:32  ). She was connected by marriage with Elisabeth, who was of the lineage of Aaron (  Luke 1:36  ).    While she resided at Nazareth with her parents, before she became the wife of Joseph, the angel Gabriel announced to her that she was to be the mother of the promised Messiah (  Luke 1:35  ). After this she went to visit her cousin Elisabeth, who was living with her husband Zacharias (probably at Juttah,   Joshua 15:55  ;   21:16  , in the neighbourhood of Maon), at a considerable distance, about 100 miles, from Nazareth. Immediately on entering the house she was saluted by Elisabeth as the mother of her Lord, and then forthwith gave utterance to her hymn of thanksgiving (  Luke 1:46-56  ; Compare   1�Samuel 2:1-10  ). After three months Mary returned to Nazareth to her own home. Joseph was supernaturally made aware (  Matthew 1:18-25  ) of her condition, and took her to his own home. Soon after this the decree of Augustus (  Luke 2:1  ) required that they should proceed to Bethlehem (  Micah 5:2  ), some 80 or 90 miles from Nazareth; and while they were there they found shelter in the inn or khan provided for strangers (  Luke 2:6   Luke 2:7  ). But as the inn was crowded, Mary had to retire to a place among the cattle, and there she brought forth her son, who was called Jesus (  Matthew 1:21  ), because he was to save his people from their sins. This was followed by the presentation in the temple, the flight into Egypt, and their return in the following year and residence at Nazareth (  Matthew 2  ). There for thirty years Mary, the wife of Joseph the carpenter, resides, filling her own humble sphere, and pondering over the strange things that had happened to her. During these years only one event in the history of Jesus is recorded, viz., his going up to Jerusalem when twelve years of age, and his being found among the doctors in the temple (  Luke 2:41-52  ). Probably also during this period Joseph died, for he is not again mentioned.    After the commencement of our Lord's public ministry little notice is taken of Mary. She was present at the marriage in Cana. A year and a half after this we find her at Capernaum (  Matthew 12:46   Matthew 12:48   Matthew 12:49  ), where Christ uttered the memorable words, ""Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!"" The next time we find her is at the cross along with her sister Mary, and Mary Magdalene, and Salome, and other women (  John 19:26  ). From that hour John took her to his own abode. She was with the little company in the upper room after the Ascension (  Acts 1:14  ). From this time she wholly disappears from public notice. The time and manner of her death are unknown.</p>",Matthias replaces Judas,,21,"Matt.1.16,Matt.1.18,Matt.1.20,Matt.2.11,Matt.13.55,Mark.3.31,Mark.6.3,Luke.1.27,Luke.1.30,Luke.1.34,Luke.1.38,Luke.1.39,Luke.1.41,Luke.1.46,Luke.1.56,Luke.2.5,Luke.2.16,Luke.2.19,Luke.2.34,John.19.25,Acts.1.14",,heli_1484,"jude_1756,jesus_905,simon_2747,joses_1721,james_719",,,,,Mary 1

On the invitation of Pharaoh (  Genesis 45:17-25  ), Jacob and his sons went down into Egypt. This immigration took place probably about 350 years before the birth of Moses. Some centuries before Joseph, Egypt had been conquered by a pastoral Semitic race from Asia, the Hyksos, who brought into cruel subjection the native Egyptians, who were an African race. Jacob and his retinue were accustomed to a shepherd's life, and on their arrival in Egypt were received with favour by the king, who assigned them the ""best of the land"", the land of Goshen, to dwell in. The Hyksos or ""shepherd"" king who thus showed favour to Joseph and his family was in all probability the Pharaoh Apopi (or Apopis).    Thus favoured, the Israelites began to ""multiply exceedingly"" (  Genesis 47:27  ), and extended to the west and south. At length the supremacy of the Hyksos came to an end. The descendants of Jacob were allowed to retain their possession of Goshen undisturbed, but after the death of Joseph their position was not so favourable. The Egyptians began to despise them, and the period of their ""affliction"" (  Genesis 15:13  ) commenced. They were sorely oppressed. They continued, however, to increase in numbers, and ""the land was filled with them"" (  Exodus 1:7  ). The native Egyptians regarded them with suspicion, so that they felt all the hardship of a struggle for existence.    In process of time ""a king [probably Seti I.] arose who knew not Joseph"" (  Exodus 1:8  ). (See  PHARAOH  .) The circumstances of the country were such that this king thought it necessary to weaken his Israelite subjects by oppressing them, and by degrees reducing their number. They were accordingly made public slaves, and were employed in connection with his numerous buildings, especially in the erection of store-cities, temples, and palaces. The children of Israel were made to serve with rigour. Their lives were made bitter with hard bondage, and ""all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour"" (  Exodus 1:13   Exodus 1:14  ). But this cruel oppression had not the result expected of reducing their number. On the contrary, ""the more the Egyptians afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew"" (  Exodus 1:12  ).    The king next tried, through a compact secretly made with the guild of midwives, to bring about the destruction of all the Hebrew male children that might be born. But the king's wish was not rigorously enforced; the male children were spared by the midwives, so that ""the people multiplied"" more than ever. Thus baffled, the king issued a public proclamation calling on the people to put to death all the Hebrew male children by casting them into the river (  Exodus 1:22  ). But neither by this edict was the king's purpose effected.    One of the Hebrew households into which this cruel edict of the king brought great alarm was that of Amram, of the family of the Kohathites (  Exodus 6:16-20  ), who with his wife Jochebed and two children, Miriam, a girl of perhaps fifteen years of age, and Aaron, a boy of three years, resided in or near Memphis, the capital city of that time. In this quiet home a male child was born (B.C. 1571). His mother concealed him in the house for three months from the knowledge of the civic authorities. But when the task of concealment became difficult, Jochebed contrived to bring her child under the notice of the daughter of the king by constructing for him an ark of bulrushes, which she laid among the flags which grew on the edge of the river at the spot where the princess was wont to come down and bathe. Her plan was successful. The king's daughter ""saw the child; and behold the child wept."" The princess (see  PHARAOH'S 'S DAUGHTER [1]) sent Miriam, who was standing by, to fetch a nurse. She went and brought the mother of the child, to whom the princess said, ""Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages."" Thus Jochebed's child, whom the princess called ""Moses"", i.e., ""Saved from the water"" (  Exodus 2:10  ), was ultimately restored to her.    As soon as the natural time for weaning the child had come, he was transferred from the humble abode of his father to the royal palace, where he was brought up as the adopted son of the princess, his mother probably accompanying him and caring still for him. He grew up amid all the grandeur and excitement of the Egyptian court, maintaining, however, probably a constant fellowship with his mother, which was of the highest importance as to his religious belief and his interest in his ""brethren."" His education would doubtless be carefully attended to, and he would enjoy all the advantages of training both as to his body and his mind. He at length became ""learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians"" (  Acts 7:22  ). Egypt had then two chief seats of learning, or universities, at one of which, probably that of Heliopolis, his education was completed. Moses, being now about twenty years of age, spent over twenty more before he came into prominence in Bible history. These twenty years were probably spent in military service. There is a tradition recorded by Josephus that he took a lead in the war which was then waged between Egypt and Ethiopia, in which he gained renown as a skilful general, and became ""mighty in deeds"" (  Acts 7:22  ).    After the termination of the war in Ethiopia, Moses returned to the Egyptian court, where he might reasonably have expected to be loaded with honours and enriched with wealth. But ""beneath the smooth current of his life hitherto, a life of alternate luxury at the court and comparative hardness in the camp and in the discharge of his military duties, there had lurked from childhood to youth, and from youth to manhood, a secret discontent, perhaps a secret ambition. Moses, amid all his Egyptian surroundings, had never forgotten, had never wished to forget, that he was a Hebrew."" He now resolved to make himself acquainted with the condition of his countrymen, and ""went out unto his brethren, and looked upon their burdens"" (  Exodus 2:11  ). This tour of inspection revealed to him the cruel oppression and bondage under which they everywhere groaned, and could not fail to press on him the serious consideration of his duty regarding them. The time had arrived for his making common cause with them, that he might thereby help to break their yoke of bondage. He made his choice accordingly (  Hebrews 11:25-27  ), assured that God would bless his resolution for the welfare of his people. He now left the palace of the king and took up his abode, probably in his father's house, as one of the Hebrew people who had for forty years been suffering cruel wrong at the hands of the Egyptians.    He could not remain indifferent to the state of things around him, and going out one day among the people, his indignation was roused against an Egyptian who was maltreating a Hebrew. He rashly lifted up his hand and slew the Egyptian, and hid his body in the sand. Next day he went out again and found two Hebrews striving together. He speedily found that the deed of the previous day was known. It reached the ears of Pharaoh (the ""great Rameses,"" Rameses II.), who ""sought to slay Moses"" (  Exodus 2:15  ). Moved by fear, Moses fled from Egypt, and betook himself to the land of Midian, the southern part of the peninsula of Sinai, probably by much the same route as that by which, forty years afterwards, he led the Israelites to Sinai. He was providentially led to find a new home with the family of Reuel, where he remained for forty years (  Acts 7:30  ), under training unconsciously for his great life's work.    Suddenly the angel of the Lord appeared to him in the burning bush (  Exodus 3  ), and commissioned him to go down to Egypt and ""bring forth the children of Israel"" out of bondage. He was at first unwilling to go, but at length he was obedient to the heavenly vision, and left the land of Midian (  4:18-26  ). On the way he was met by Aaron (q.v.) and the elders of Israel (27-31). He and Aaron had a hard task before them; but the Lord was with them (ch. 7-12), and the ransomed host went forth in triumph. (See  EXODUS  .) After an eventful journey to and fro in the wilderness, we see them at length encamped in the plains of Moab, ready to cross over the Jordan into the Promised Land. There Moses addressed the assembled elders (  Deuteronomy 1:1-4  ;   5:1-26:19;  ;   27:11-30:20),  ), and gives the people his last counsels, and then rehearses the great song (  Deuteronomy 32  ), clothing in fitting words the deep emotions of his heart at such a time, and in review of such a marvellous history as that in which he had acted so conspicious a part. Then, after blessing the tribes (33), he ascends to ""the mountain of Nebo (q.v.), to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho"" (  34:1  ), and from thence he surveys the land. ""Jehovah shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea, and the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar"" (  Deuteronomy 34:2-3  ), the magnificient inheritance of the tribes of whom he had been so long the leader; and there he died, being one hundred and twenty years old, according to the word of the Lord, and was buried by the Lord ""in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor"" (  34:6  ). The people mourned for him during thirty days.    Thus died ""Moses the man of God"" (  Deuteronomy 33:1  ;   Joshua 14:6  ). He was distinguished for his meekness and patience and firmness, and ""he endured as seeing him who is invisible."" ""There arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face, in all the signs and the wonders, which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land, and in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel"" (  Deuteronomy 34:10-12  ).    The name of Moses occurs frequently in the Psalms and Prophets as the chief of the prophets.   In the New Testament he is referred to as the representative of the law and as a type of Christ (  John 1:17  ;   2  co   3:13-18  ;   Hebrews 3:5   Hebrews 3:6  ). Moses is the only character in the Old Testament to whom Christ likens himself (  John 5:46  ; Compare   Deuteronomy 18:15   Deuteronomy 18:18   Deuteronomy 18:19  ;   Acts 7:37  ). In   Hebrews 3:1-19   this likeness to Moses is set forth in various particulars.    In   Jude 1:9   mention is made of a contention between Michael and the devil about the body of Moses. This dispute is supposed to have had reference to the concealment of the body of Moses so as to prevent idolatry.",,,774,"Exod.2.10,Exod.2.11,Exod.2.14,Exod.2.15,Exod.2.17,Exod.2.21,Exod.3.1,Exod.3.3,Exod.3.4,Exod.3.6,Exod.3.11,Exod.3.13,Exod.3.14,Exod.3.15,Exod.4.1,Exod.4.3,Exod.4.4,Exod.4.10,Exod.4.14,Exod.4.18,Exod.4.19,Exod.4.20,Exod.4.21,Exod.4.27,Exod.4.28,Exod.4.29,Exod.4.30,Exod.5.1,Exod.5.4,Exod.5.20,Exod.5.22,Exod.6.1,Exod.6.2,Exod.6.9,Exod.6.10,Exod.6.12,Exod.6.13,Exod.6.20,Exod.6.26,Exod.6.27,Exod.6.28,Exod.6.29,Exod.6.30,Exod.7.1,Exod.7.6,Exod.7.7,Exod.7.8,Exod.7.10,Exod.7.14,Exod.7.19,Exod.7.20,Exod.8.1,Exod.8.5,Exod.8.8,Exod.8.9,Exod.8.12,Exod.8.13,Exod.8.16,Exod.8.20,Exod.8.25,Exod.8.26,Exod.8.29,Exod.8.30,Exod.8.31,Exod.9.1,Exod.9.8,Exod.9.10,Exod.9.11,Exod.9.12,Exod.9.13,Exod.9.22,Exod.9.23,Exod.9.27,Exod.9.29,Exod.9.33,Exod.9.35,Exod.10.1,Exod.10.3,Exod.10.8,Exod.10.9,Exod.10.12,Exod.10.13,Exod.10.16,Exod.10.21,Exod.10.22,Exod.10.24,Exod.10.25,Exod.10.29,Exod.11.1,Exod.11.3,Exod.11.4,Exod.11.9,Exod.11.10,Exod.12.1,Exod.12.21,Exod.12.28,Exod.12.31,Exod.12.35,Exod.12.43,Exod.12.50,Exod.13.1,Exod.13.3,Exod.13.19,Exod.14.1,Exod.14.11,Exod.14.13,Exod.14.15,Exod.14.21,Exod.14.26,Exod.14.27,Exod.14.31,Exod.15.1,Exod.15.22,Exod.15.24,Exod.16.2,Exod.16.4,Exod.16.6,Exod.16.8,Exod.16.9,Exod.16.11,Exod.16.15,Exod.16.19,Exod.16.20,Exod.16.22,Exod.16.24,Exod.16.25,Exod.16.28,Exod.16.32,Exod.16.33,Exod.16.34,Exod.17.2,Exod.17.3,Exod.17.4,Exod.17.5,Exod.17.6,Exod.17.9,Exod.17.10,Exod.17.11,Exod.17.14,Exod.17.15,Exod.18.1,Exod.18.5,Exod.18.6,Exod.18.7,Exod.18.8,Exod.18.13,Exod.18.15,Exod.18.24,Exod.18.25,Exod.18.26,Exod.18.27,Exod.19.3,Exod.19.7,Exod.19.8,Exod.19.9,Exod.19.10,Exod.19.14,Exod.19.17,Exod.19.19,Exod.19.20,Exod.19.21,Exod.19.23,Exod.19.25,Exod.20.19,Exod.20.20,Exod.20.21,Exod.20.22,Exod.24.1,Exod.24.2,Exod.24.3,Exod.24.4,Exod.24.6,Exod.24.8,Exod.24.9,Exod.24.12,Exod.24.13,Exod.24.15,Exod.24.16,Exod.24.18,Exod.25.1,Exod.30.11,Exod.30.17,Exod.30.22,Exod.30.34,Exod.31.1,Exod.31.12,Exod.31.18,Exod.32.1,Exod.32.7,Exod.32.9,Exod.32.11,Exod.32.15,Exod.32.17,Exod.32.21,Exod.32.23,Exod.32.25,Exod.32.26,Exod.32.28,Exod.32.29,Exod.32.30,Exod.32.31,Exod.32.33,Exod.33.1,Exod.33.5,Exod.33.7,Exod.33.8,Exod.33.9,Exod.33.11,Exod.33.12,Exod.33.17,Exod.34.1,Exod.34.4,Exod.34.8,Exod.34.27,Exod.34.29,Exod.34.30,Exod.34.31,Exod.34.33,Exod.34.34,Exod.34.35,Exod.35.1,Exod.35.4,Exod.35.20,Exod.35.29,Exod.35.30,Exod.36.2,Exod.36.3,Exod.36.5,Exod.36.6,Exod.38.21,Exod.38.22,Exod.39.1,Exod.39.5,Exod.39.7,Exod.39.21,Exod.39.26,Exod.39.29,Exod.39.31,Exod.39.32,Exod.39.33,Exod.39.42,Exod.39.43,Exod.40.1,Exod.40.16,Exod.40.18,Exod.40.19,Exod.40.21,Exod.40.23,Exod.40.25,Exod.40.27,Exod.40.29,Exod.40.31,Exod.40.32,Exod.40.33,Exod.40.35,Lev.1.1,Lev.4.1,Lev.5.14,Lev.6.1,Lev.6.8,Lev.6.19,Lev.6.24,Lev.7.22,Lev.7.28,Lev.7.38,Lev.8.1,Lev.8.4,Lev.8.5,Lev.8.6,Lev.8.9,Lev.8.10,Lev.8.13,Lev.8.15,Lev.8.16,Lev.8.17,Lev.8.19,Lev.8.20,Lev.8.21,Lev.8.23,Lev.8.24,Lev.8.28,Lev.8.29,Lev.8.30,Lev.8.31,Lev.8.36,Lev.9.1,Lev.9.5,Lev.9.6,Lev.9.7,Lev.9.10,Lev.9.21,Lev.9.23,Lev.10.3,Lev.10.4,Lev.10.5,Lev.10.6,Lev.10.7,Lev.10.11,Lev.10.12,Lev.10.16,Lev.10.19,Lev.10.20,Lev.11.1,Lev.12.1,Lev.13.1,Lev.14.1,Lev.14.33,Lev.15.1,Lev.16.1,Lev.16.2,Lev.16.34,Lev.17.1,Lev.18.1,Lev.19.1,Lev.20.1,Lev.21.1,Lev.21.16,Lev.21.24,Lev.22.1,Lev.22.17,Lev.22.26,Lev.23.1,Lev.23.9,Lev.23.23,Lev.23.26,Lev.23.33,Lev.23.44,Lev.24.1,Lev.24.11,Lev.24.13,Lev.24.23,Lev.25.1,Lev.26.46,Lev.27.1,Lev.27.34,Num.1.1,Num.1.17,Num.1.19,Num.1.44,Num.1.48,Num.1.54,Num.2.1,Num.2.33,Num.2.34,Num.3.1,Num.3.5,Num.3.11,Num.3.14,Num.3.16,Num.3.38,Num.3.39,Num.3.40,Num.3.42,Num.3.44,Num.3.49,Num.3.51,Num.4.1,Num.4.17,Num.4.21,Num.4.34,Num.4.37,Num.4.41,Num.4.45,Num.4.46,Num.4.49,Num.5.1,Num.5.4,Num.5.5,Num.5.11,Num.6.1,Num.6.22,Num.7.1,Num.7.4,Num.7.6,Num.7.11,Num.7.89,Num.8.1,Num.8.3,Num.8.4,Num.8.5,Num.8.20,Num.8.22,Num.8.23,Num.9.1,Num.9.4,Num.9.5,Num.9.6,Num.9.8,Num.9.9,Num.9.23,Num.10.1,Num.10.13,Num.10.29,Num.10.35,Num.11.2,Num.11.10,Num.11.11,Num.11.16,Num.11.21,Num.11.23,Num.11.24,Num.11.27,Num.11.28,Num.11.29,Num.11.30,Num.12.1,Num.12.2,Num.12.3,Num.12.4,Num.12.7,Num.12.8,Num.12.11,Num.12.13,Num.12.14,Num.13.1,Num.13.3,Num.13.16,Num.13.17,Num.13.26,Num.13.30,Num.14.2,Num.14.5,Num.14.11,Num.14.13,Num.14.26,Num.14.36,Num.14.39,Num.14.41,Num.14.44,Num.15.1,Num.15.17,Num.15.22,Num.15.23,Num.15.33,Num.15.35,Num.15.36,Num.15.37,Num.16.2,Num.16.3,Num.16.4,Num.16.8,Num.16.12,Num.16.15,Num.16.16,Num.16.18,Num.16.20,Num.16.23,Num.16.25,Num.16.28,Num.16.36,Num.16.40,Num.16.41,Num.16.42,Num.16.43,Num.16.44,Num.16.46,Num.16.47,Num.16.50,Num.17.1,Num.17.6,Num.17.7,Num.17.8,Num.17.9,Num.17.10,Num.17.11,Num.17.12,Num.18.25,Num.19.1,Num.20.2,Num.20.3,Num.20.6,Num.20.7,Num.20.9,Num.20.10,Num.20.11,Num.20.12,Num.20.14,Num.20.23,Num.20.27,Num.20.28,Num.21.5,Num.21.7,Num.21.8,Num.21.9,Num.21.16,Num.21.32,Num.21.34,Num.25.4,Num.25.5,Num.25.6,Num.25.10,Num.25.16,Num.26.1,Num.26.3,Num.26.4,Num.26.9,Num.26.52,Num.26.59,Num.26.63,Num.26.64,Num.27.2,Num.27.5,Num.27.6,Num.27.11,Num.27.12,Num.27.15,Num.27.18,Num.27.22,

His circumcision-name was Saul, and probably the name Paul was also given to him in infancy ""for use in the Gentile world,"" as ""Saul"" would be his Hebrew home-name. He was a native of Tarsus, the capital of Cilicia, a Roman province in the south-east of Asia Minor. That city stood on the banks of the river Cydnus, which was navigable thus far; hence it became a centre of extensive commercial traffic with many countries along the shores of the Mediterranean, as well as with the countries of central Asia Minor. It thus became a city distinguished for the wealth of its inhabitants.   Tarsus was also the seat of a famous university, higher in reputation even than the universities of Athens and Alexandria, the only others that then existed. Here Saul was born, and here he spent his youth, doubtless enjoying the best education his native city could afford. His father was of the straitest sect of the Jews, a Pharisee, of the tribe of Benjamin, of pure and unmixed Jewish blood (  Acts 23:6  ; Phil   3:5  ). We learn nothing regarding his mother; but there is reason to conclude that she was a pious woman, and that, like-minded with her husband, she exercised all a mother influence in moulding the character of her son, so that he could afterwards speak of himself as being, from his youth up, ""touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless"" (Phil   3:6  ).    We read of his sister and his sister's son (  Acts 23:16  ), and of other relatives (  Romans 16:7   Romans 16:11   Romans 16:12  ). Though a Jew, his father was a Roman citizen. How he obtained this privilege we are not informed. ""It might be bought, or won by distinguished service to the state, or acquired in several other ways; at all events, his son was freeborn. It was a valuable privilege, and one that was to prove of great use to Paul, although not in the way in which his father might have been expected to desire him to make use of it."" Perhaps the most natural career for the youth to follow was that of a merchant. ""But it was decided that...he should go to college and become a rabbi, that is, a minister, a teacher, and a lawyer all in one.""    According to Jewish custom, however, he learned a trade before entering on the more direct preparation for the sacred profession. The trade he acquired was the making of tents from goats' hair cloth, a trade which was one of the commonest in Tarsus.   His preliminary education having been completed, Saul was sent, when about thirteen years of age probably, to the great Jewish school of sacred learning at Jerusalem as a student of the law. Here he became a pupil of the celebrated rabbi Gamaliel, and here he spent many years in an elaborate study of the Scriptures and of the many questions concerning them with which the rabbis exercised themselves. During these years of diligent study he lived ""in all good conscience,"" unstained by the vices of that great city.   After the period of his student-life expired, he probably left Jerusalem for Tarsus, where he may have been engaged in connection with some synagogue for some years. But we find him back again at Jerusalem very soon after the death of our Lord. Here he now learned the particulars regarding the crucifixion, and the rise of the new sect of the ""Nazarenes.""   For some two years after Pentecost, Christianity was quietly spreading its influence in Jerusalem. At length Stephen, one of the seven deacons, gave forth more public and aggressive testimony that Jesus was the Messiah, and this led to much excitement among the Jews and much disputation in their synagogues. Persecution arose against Stephen and the followers of Christ generally, in which Saul of Tarsus took a prominent part. He was at this time probably a member of the great Sanhedrin, and became the active leader in the furious persecution by which the rulers then sought to exterminate Christianity.   But the object of this persecution also failed. ""They that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word."" The anger of the persecutor was thereby kindled into a fiercer flame. Hearing that fugitives had taken refuge in Damascus, he obtained from the chief priest letters authorizing him to proceed thither on his persecuting career. This was a long journey of about 130 miles, which would occupy perhaps six days, during which, with his few attendants, he steadily went onward, ""breathing out threatenings and slaughter."" But the crisis of his life was at hand. He had reached the last stage of his journey, and was within sight of Damascus. As he and his companions rode on, suddenly at mid-day a brilliant light shone round them, and Saul was laid prostrate in terror on the ground, a voice sounding in his ears, ""Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?"" The risen Saviour was there, clothed in the vesture of his glorified humanity. In answer to the anxious inquiry of the stricken persecutor, ""Who art thou, Lord?"" he said, ""I am Jesus whom thou persecutest"" (  Acts 9:5  ;   22:8  ;   26:15  ).    This was the moment of his conversion, the most solemn in all his life. Blinded by the dazzling light (  Acts 9:8  ), his companions led him into the city, where, absorbed in deep thought for three days, he neither ate nor drank (  9:11  ). Ananias, a disciple living in Damascus, was informed by a vision of the change that had happened to Saul, and was sent to him to open his eyes and admit him by baptism into the Christian church (  9:11-16  ). The whole purpose of his life was now permanently changed.    Immediately after his conversion he retired into the solitudes of Arabia (  Galatians 1:17  ), perhaps of ""Sinai in Arabia,"" for the purpose, probably, of devout study and meditation on the marvellous revelation that had been made to him. ""A veil of thick darkness hangs over this visit to Arabia. Of the scenes among which he moved, of the thoughts and occupations which engaged him while there, of all the circumstances of a crisis which must have shaped the whole tenor of his after-life, absolutely nothing is known. 'Immediately,' says St. Paul, 'I went away into Arabia.' The historian passes over the incident [Compare   Acts 9:23   and   1 Kings 11:38   1 Kings 11:39  ]. It is a mysterious pause, a moment of suspense, in the apostle's history, a breathless calm, which ushers in the tumultuous storm of his active missionary life."" Coming back, after three years, to Damascus, he began to preach the gospel ""boldly in the name of Jesus"" (  Acts 9:27  ), but was soon obliged to flee (  9:25  ;   2  co.  11:33 ) from the Jews and betake himself to Jerusalem. Here he tarried for three weeks, but was again forced to flee (  Acts 9:28   Acts 9:29  ) from persecution. He now returned to his native Tarsus (  Galatians 1:21  ), where, for probably about three years, we lose sight of him. The time had not yet come for his entering on his great life-work of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles.    At length the city of Antioch, the capital of Syria, became the scene of great Christian activity. There the gospel gained a firm footing, and the cause of Christ prospered. Barnabas (q.v.), who had been sent from Jerusalem to superintend the work at Antioch, found it too much for him, and remembering Saul, he set out to Tarsus to seek for him. He readily responded to the call thus addressed to him, and came down to Antioch, which for ""a whole year"" became the scene of his labours, which were crowned with great success. The disciples now, for the first time, were called ""Christians"" (  Acts 11:26  ).    The church at Antioch now proposed to send out missionaries to the Gentiles, and Saul and Barnabas, with John Mark as their attendant, were chosen for this work. This was a great epoch in the history of the church. Now the disciples began to give effect to the Master's command: ""Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.""   The three missionaries went forth on the first missionary tour. They sailed from Seleucia, the seaport of Antioch, across to Cyprus, some 80 miles to the south-west. Here at Paphos, Sergius Paulus, the Roman proconsul, was converted, and now Saul took the lead, and was ever afterwards called Paul. The missionaries now crossed to the mainland, and then proceeded 6 or 7 miles up the river Cestrus to Perga (  Acts 13:13  ), where John Mark deserted the work and returned to Jerusalem. The two then proceeded about 100 miles inland, passing through Pamphylia, Pisidia, and Lycaonia. The towns mentioned in this tour are the Pisidian Antioch, where Paul delivered his first address of which we have any record (  13:16-51  ; comp   10:30-43  ), Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe. They returned by the same route to see and encourage the converts they had made, and ordain elders in every city to watch over the churches which had been gathered. From Perga they sailed direct for Antioch, from which they had set out.    After remaining ""a long time"", probably till A.D. 50 or 51, in Antioch, a great controversy broke out in the church there regarding the relation of the Gentiles to the Mosaic law. For the purpose of obtaining a settlement of this question, Paul and Barnabas were sent as deputies to consult the church at Jerusalem. The council or synod which was there held (  Acts 15  ) decided against the Judaizing party; and the deputies, accompanied by Judas and Silas, returned to Antioch, bringing with them the decree of the council.    After a short rest at Antioch, Paul said to Barnabas: ""Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do."" Mark proposed again to accompany them; but Paul refused to allow him to go. Barnabas was resolved to take Mark, and thus he and Paul had a sharp contention. They separated, and never again met. Paul, however, afterwards speaks with honour of Barnabas, and sends for Mark to come to him at Rome (  Colossians 4:10  ;   2  Tim   4:11  ).    Paul took with him Silas, instead of Barnabas, and began his second missionary journey about A.D. 51. This time he went by land, revisiting the churches he had already founded in Asia. But he longed to enter into ""regions beyond,"" and still went forward through Phrygia and Galatia ( 16:6 ). Contrary to his intention, he was constrained to linger in Galatia (q.v.), on account of some bodily affliction (  Galatians 4:13   Galatians 4:14  ). Bithynia, a populous province on the shore of the Black Sea, lay now before him, and he wished to enter it; but the way was shut, the Spirit in some manner guiding him in another direction, till he came down to the shores of the AEgean and arrived at Troas, on the north-western coast of Asia Minor (  Acts 16:8  ). Of this long journey from Antioch to Troas we have no account except some references to it in his Epistle to the (  Galatians 4:13  ).    As he waited at Troas for indications of the will of God as to his future movements, he saw, in the vision of the night, a man from the opposite shores of Macedonia standing before him, and heard him cry, ""Come over, and help us"" (  Acts 16:9  ). Paul recognized in this vision a message from the Lord, and the very next day set sail across the Hellespont, which separated him from Europe, and carried the tidings of the gospel into the Western world. In Macedonia, churches were planted in Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea. Leaving this province, Paul passed into Achaia, ""the paradise of genius and renown."" He reached Athens, but quitted it after, probably, a brief sojourn (  17:17-31  ). The Athenians had received him with cold disdain, and he never visited that city again. He passed over to Corinth, the seat of the Roman government of Achaia, and remained there a year and a half, labouring with much success. While at Corinth, he wrote his two epistles to the church of Thessalonica, his earliest apostolic letters, and then sailed for Syria, that he might be in time to keep the feast of Pentecost at Jerusalem. He was accompanied by Aquila and Priscilla, whom he left at Ephesus, at which he touched, after a voyage of thirteen or fifteen days. He landed at Caesarea, and went up to Jerusalem, and having ""saluted the church"" there, and kept the feast, he left for Antioch, where he abode ""some time"" (  Acts 18:20-23  ).    He then began his third missionary tour. He journeyed by land in the ""upper coasts"" (the more eastern parts) of Asia Minor, and at length made his way to Ephesus, where he tarried for no less than three years, engaged in ceaseless Christian labour. ""This city was at the time the Liverpool of the Mediterranean. It possessed a splendid harbour, in which was concentrated the traffic of the sea which was then the highway of the nations; and as Liverpool has behind her the great towns of Lancashire, so had Ephesus behind and around her such cities as those mentioned along with her in the epistles to the churches in the book of Revelation, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea. It was a city of vast wealth, and it was given over to every kind of pleasure, the fame of its theatres and race-course being world-wide"" (Stalker's Life of St. Paul). Here a ""great door and effectual"" was opened to the apostle. His fellow-labourers aided him in his work, carrying the gospel to Colosse and Laodicea and other places which they could reach.   Very shortly before his departure from Ephesus, the apostle wrote his First Epistle to the Corinthians (q.v.). The silversmiths, whose traffic in the little images which they made was in danger (see  DEMETRIUS ), organized a riot against Paul, and he left the city, and proceeded to Troas (  2�Corinthians 2:12  ), whence after some time he went to meet Titus in Macedonia. Here, in consequence of the report Titus brought from Corinth, he wrote his second epistle to that church. Having spent probably most of the summer and autumn in Macedonia, visiting the churches there, specially the churches of Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea, probably penetrating into the interior, to the shores of the Adriatic (  Romans 15:19  ), he then came into Greece, where he abode three month, spending probably the greater part of this time in Corinth (  Acts 20:2  ). During his stay in this city he wrote his Epistle to the Galatians, and also the great Epistle to the Romans. At the end of the three months he left Achaia for Macedonia, thence crossed into Asia Minor, and touching at Miletus, there addressed the Ephesian presbyters, whom he had sent for to meet him (  Acts 20:17  ), and then sailed for Tyre, finally reaching Jerusalem, probably in the spring of A.D. 58.    While at Jerusalem, at the feast of Pentecost, he was almost murdered by a Jewish mob in the temple. (See TEMPLE, HEROD'S.) Rescued from their violence by the Roman commandant, he was conveyed as a prisoner to Caesarea, where, from various causes, he was detained a prisoner for two years in Herod's praetorium (  Acts 23:35  ). ""Paul was not kept in close confinement; he had at least the range of the barracks in which he was detained. There we can imagine him pacing the ramparts on the edge of the Mediterranean, and gazing wistfully across the blue waters in the direction of Macedonia, Achaia, and Ephesus, where his spiritual children were pining for him, or perhaps encountering dangers in which they sorely needed his presence. It was a mysterious providence which thus arrested his energies and condemned the ardent worker to inactivity; yet we can now see the reason for it. Paul was needing rest. After twenty years of incessant evangelization, he required leisure to garner the harvest of experience...During these two years he wrote nothing; it was a time of internal mental activity and silent progress"" (Stalker's Life of St. Paul).    At the end of these two years Felix (q.v.) was succeeded in the governorship of Palestine by Porcius Festus, before whom the apostle was again heard. But judging it right at this crisis to claim the privilege of a Roman citizen, he appealed to the emperor (  Acts 25:11  ). Such an appeal could not be disregarded, and Paul was at once sent on to Rome under the charge of one Julius, a centurion of the ""Augustan cohort."" After a long and perilous voyage, he at length reached the imperial city in the early spring, probably, of A.D. 61. Here he was permitted to occupy his own hired house, under constant military custody. This privilege was accorded to him, no doubt, because he was a Roman citizen, and as such could not be put into prison without a trial. The soldiers who kept guard over Paul were of course changed at frequent intervals, and thus he had the opportunity of preaching the gospel to many of them during these ""two whole years,"" and with the blessed result of spreading among the imperial guards, and even in Caesar's household, an interest in the truth (Phil   1:13  ). His rooms were resorted to by many anxious inquirers, both Jews and Gentiles (  Acts 28:23   Acts 28:30   Acts 28:31  ), and thus his imprisonment ""turned rather to the furtherance of the gospel,"" and his ""hired house"" became the centre of a gracious influence which spread over the whole city. According to a Jewish tradition, it was situated on the borders of the modern Ghetto, which has been the Jewish quarters in Rome from the time of Pompey to the present day. During this period the apostle wrote his epistles to the Colossians, Ephesians, Philippians, and to Philemon, and probably also to the Hebrews.    This first imprisonment came at length to a close, Paul having been acquitted, probably because no witnesses appeared against him. Once more he set out on his missionary labours, probably visiting western and eastern Europe and Asia Minor. During this period of freedom he wrote his First Epistle to Timothy and his Epistle to Titus. The year of his release was signalized by the burning of Rome, which Nero saw fit to attribute to the Christians. A fierce persecution now broke out against the Christians. Paul was siezed, and once more conveyed to Rome a prisoner. During this imprisonment he probably wrote the Second Epistle to Timothy, the last he ever wrote. ""There can be little doubt that he appered again at Nero's bar, and this time the charge did not break down. In all history there is not a more startling illustration of the irony of human life than this scene of Paul at the bar of Nero. On the judgment-seat, clad in the imperial purple, sat a man who, in a bad world, had attained the eminence of being the very worst and meanest being in it, a man stained with every crime, a man whose whole being was so steeped in every nameable and unnameable vice, that body and soul of him were, as some one said at the time, nothing but a compound of mud and blood; and in the prisoner's dock stood the best man the world possessed, his hair whitened with labours for the good of men and the glory of God. The trial ended: Paul was condemned, and delivered over to the executioner. He was led out of the city, with a crowd of the lowest rabble at his heels.

To the old native Egyptians, who were an African race, shepherds were ""an abomination;"" but to the Hyksos kings these Asiatic shepherds who now appeared with Jacob at their head were congenial, and being akin to their own race, had a warm welcome (  Genesis 47:5    Genesis 47:6  ). Some argue that Joseph came to Egypt in the reign of Thothmes III., long after the expulsion of the Hyksos, and that his influence is to be seen in the rise and progress of the religious revolution in the direction of monotheism which characterized the middle of the Eighteenth Dynasty. The wife of Amenophis III., of that dynasty, was a Semite. Is this singular fact to be explained from the presence of some of Joseph's kindred at the Egyptian court? Pharaoh said to Joseph, ""Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee: the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell"" (  Genesis 47:5    Genesis 47:6  ).

He resided at Zoan, where he had the various interviews with Moses and Aaron recorded in the book of Exodus. His mummy was not among those found at Deir el-Bahari. It is still a question, however, whether Seti II. or his father Menephtah was the Pharaoh of the Exodus. Some think the balance of evidence to be in favour of the former, whose reign it is known began peacefully, but came to a sudden and disastrous end. The ""Harris papyrus,"" found at Medinet-Abou in Upper Egypt in 1856, a state document written by Rameses III., the second king of the Twentieth Dynasty, gives at length an account of a great exodus from Egypt, followed by wide-spread confusion and anarchy. This, there is great reason to believe, was the Hebrew exodus, with which the Nineteenth Dynasty of the Pharaohs came to an end. This period of anarchy was brought to a close by Setnekht, the founder of the Twentieth Dynasty.    ""In the spring of 1896, Professor Flinders Petrie discovered, among the ruins of the temple of Menephtah at Thebes, a large granite stela, on which is engraved a hymn of victory commemorating the defeat of Libyan invaders who had overrun the Delta. At the end other victories of Menephtah are glanced at, and it is said that 'the Israelites (I-s-y-r-a-e-l-u) are minished (?) so that they have no seed.' Menephtah was son and successor of Rameses II., the builder of Pithom, and Egyptian scholars have long seen in him the Pharaoh of the Exodus. The Exodus is also placed in his reign by the Egyptian legend of the event preserved by the historian Manetho. In the inscription the name of the Israelites has no determinative of 'country' or 'district' attached to it, as is the case with all the other names (Canaan, Ashkelon, Gezer, Khar or Southern Palestine, etc.) mentioned along with it, and it would therefore appear that at the time the hymn was composed, the Israelites had already been lost to the sight of the Egyptians in the desert. At all events they must have had as yet no fixed home or district of their own. We may therefore see in the reference to them the Pharaoh's version of the Exodus, the disasters which befell the Egyptians being naturally passed over in silence, and only the destruction of the 'men children' of the Israelites being recorded. The statement of the Egyptian poet is a remarkable parallel to   Exodus 1:10-22  .""",,,138,"Gen.12.15,Gen.37.36,Gen.40.7,Gen.40.11,Gen.40.13,Gen.40.20,Gen.40.21,Gen.47.14,Gen.47.20,Gen.47.25,Gen.47.26,Exod.2.7,Exod.2.8,Exod.2.9,Exod.2.10,Exod.3.10,Exod.3.11,Exod.4.21,Exod.4.22,Exod.5.1,Exod.5.2,Exod.5.5,Exod.5.6,Exod.5.10,Exod.5.14,Exod.5.15,Exod.5.20,Exod.5.21,Exod.5.23,Exod.6.1,Exod.6.11,Exod.6.12,Exod.6.13,Exod.6.27,Exod.6.29,Exod.6.30,Exod.7.1,Exod.7.2,Exod.7.3,Exod.7.4,Exod.7.7,Exod.7.9,Exod.7.10,Exod.7.11,Exod.7.13,Exod.7.14,Exod.7.15,Exod.7.20,Exod.7.22,Exod.7.23,Exod.8.1,Exod.8.8,Exod.8.9,Exod.8.12,Exod.8.15,Exod.8.19,Exod.8.20,Exod.8.24,Exod.8.25,Exod.8.28,Exod.8.29,Exod.8.30,Exod.8.31,Exod.8.32,Exod.9.1,Exod.9.7,Exod.9.8,Exod.9.10,Exod.9.12,Exod.9.13,Exod.9.20,Exod.9.27,Exod.9.33,Exod.9.34,Exod.9.35,Exod.10.1,Exod.10.3,Exod.10.6,Exod.10.7,Exod.10.8,Exod.10.11,Exod.10.16,Exod.10.18,Exod.10.20,Exod.10.24,Exod.10.27,Exod.10.28,Exod.11.1,Exod.11.3,Exod.11.5,Exod.11.8,Exod.11.9,Exod.11.10,Exod.12.29,Exod.12.30,Exod.13.15,Exod.13.17,Exod.14.3,Exod.14.4,Exod.14.5,Exod.14.8,Exod.14.9,Exod.14.10,Exod.14.17,Exod.14.18,Exod.14.23,Exod.14.28,Exod.15.4,Exod.15.19,Exod.18.4,Exod.18.8,Exod.18.10,Deut.6.21,Deut.6.22,Deut.7.8,Deut.7.18,Deut.11.3,Deut.29.2,Deut.34.11,1Sam.2.27,1Sam.6.6,1Kgs.3.1,1Kgs.7.8,1Kgs.9.24,1Kgs.11.20,2Kgs.17.7,Neh.9.10,Ps.135.9,Ps.136.15,Song.1.9,Jer.37.5,Jer.37.7,Jer.37.11,Jer.43.9,Ezek.30.24,Acts.7.21,Rom.9.17,Heb.11.24",,,,,,,,Pharaoh 5

He was one of those who were ""scattered abroad"" by the persecution that arose on the death of Stephen. He went first to Samaria, where he laboured as an evangelist with much success (  8:5-13  ). While he was there he received a divine command to proceed toward the south, along the road leading from Jerusalem to Gaza. These towns were connected by two roads. The one Philip was directed to take was that which led through Hebron, and thence through a district little inhabited, and hence called ""desert."" As he travelled along this road he was overtaken by a chariot in which sat a man of Ethiopia, the eunuch or chief officer of Queen Candace, who was at that moment reading, probably from the Septuagint version, a portion of the prophecies of (  Isaiah 53:6   Isaiah 53:7  ). Philip entered into conversation with him, and expounded these verses, preaching to him the glad tidings of the Saviour. The eunuch received the message and believed, and was forthwith baptized, and then ""went on his way rejoicing."" Philip was instantly caught away by the Spirit after the baptism, and the eunuch saw him no more. He was next found at Azotus, whence he went forth in his evangelistic work till he came to Caesarea. He is not mentioned again for about twenty years, when he is still found at Caesarea (  Acts 21:8  ) when Paul and his companions were on the way to Jerusalem. He then finally disappears from the page of history.","Seven chosen to serve, Philip preaches in Samaria, Conversion of Ethiopian Eunuch, Voyage from Miletus to Jerusalem",,16,"Acts.6.5,Acts.8.5,Acts.8.6,Acts.8.12,Acts.8.13,Acts.8.26,Acts.8.29,Acts.8.30,Acts.8.31,Acts.8.34,Acts.8.35,Acts.8.37,Acts.8.38,Acts.8.39,Acts.8.40,Acts.21.8",,,,,,,,Philip 2

He was the sixth in the order of the Roman procurators of Judea (A.D. 26-36). His headquarters were at Caesarea, but he frequently went up to Jerusalem. His reign extended over the period of the ministry of John the Baptist and of Jesus Christ, in connection with whose trial his name comes into prominent notice. Pilate was a ""typical Roman, not of the antique, simple stamp, but of the imperial period, a man not without some remains of the ancient Roman justice in his soul, yet pleasure-loving, imperious, and corrupt. He hated the Jews whom he ruled, and in times of irritation freely shed their blood. They returned his hatred with cordiality, and accused him of every crime, maladministration, cruelty, and robbery. He visited Jerusalem as seldom as possible; for, indeed, to one accustomed to the pleasures of Rome, with its theatres, baths, games, and gay society, Jerusalem, with its religiousness and ever-smouldering revolt, was a dreary residence. When he did visit it he stayed in the palace of Herod the Great, it being common for the officers sent by Rome into conquered countries to occupy the palaces of the displaced sovereigns.""    After his trial before the Sanhedrin, Jesus was brought to the Roman procurator, Pilate, who had come up to Jerusalem as usual to preserve order during the Passover, and was now residing, perhaps, in the castle of Antonia, or it may be in Herod's palace. Pilate came forth from his palace and met the deputation from the Sanhedrin, who, in answer to his inquiry as to the nature of the accusation they had to prefer against Jesus, accused him of being a ""malefactor."" Pilate was not satisfied with this, and they further accused him (1) of sedition, (2) preventing the payment of the tribute to Caesar, and (3) of assuming the title of king (  Luke 23:2  ). Pilate now withdrew with Jesus into the palace (  John 18:33  ) and examined him in private (37,38); and then going out to the deputation still standing before the gate, he declared that he could find no fault in Jesus (  Luke 23:4  ). This only aroused them to more furious clamour, and they cried that he excited the populace ""throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee."" When Pilate heard of Galilee, he sent the accused to Herod Antipas, who had jurisdiction over that province, thus hoping to escape the difficulty in which he found himself. But Herod, with his men of war, set Jesus at nought, and sent him back again to Pilate, clad in a purple robe of mockery (  Luke 23:11   Luke 23:12  ).    Pilate now proposed that as he and Herod had found no fault in him, they should release Jesus; and anticipating that they would consent to this proposal, he ascended the judgment-seat as if ready to ratify the decision (  Matthew 27:19  ). But at this moment his wife (Claudia Procula) sent a message to him imploring him to have nothing to do with the ""just person."" Pilate's feelings of perplexity and awe were deepened by this incident, while the crowd vehemently cried out, ""Not this man, but Barabbas."" Pilate answered, ""What then shall I do with Jesus?"" The fierce cry immediately followed. ""Let him be crucified."" Pilate, apparently vexed, and not knowning what to do, said, ""Why, what evil hath he done?"" but with yet fiercer fanaticism the crowd yelled out, ""Away with him! crucify him, crucify him!"" Pilate yielded, and sent Jesus away to be scourged. This scourging was usually inflicted by lictors; but as Pilate was only a procurator he had no lictor, and hence his soldiers inflicted this terrible punishment. This done, the soldiers began to deride the sufferer, and they threw around him a purple robe, probably some old cast-off robe of state (  Matthew 27:28  ;   John 19:2  ), and putting a reed in his right hand, and a crowd of thorns on his head, bowed the knee before him in mockery, and saluted him, saying, ""Hail, King of the Jews!"" They took also the reed and smote him with it on the head and face, and spat in his face, heaping upon him every indignity.    Pilate then led forth Jesus from within the Praetorium (  Matthew 27:27  ) before the people, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, saying, ""Behold the man!"" But the sight of Jesus, now scourged and crowned and bleeding, only stirred their hatred the more, and again they cried out, ""Crucify him, crucify him!"" and brought forth this additional charge against him, that he professed to be ""the Son of God."" Pilate heard this accusation with a superstitious awe, and taking him once more within the Praetorium, asked him, ""Whence art thou?"" Jesus gave him no answer. Pilate was irritated by his continued silence, and said, ""Knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee?"" Jesus, with calm dignity, answered the Roman, ""Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above.""    After this Pilate seemed more resolved than ever to let Jesus go. The crowd perceiving this cried out, ""If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend."" This settled the matter. He was afraid of being accused to the emperor. Calling for water, he washed his hands in the sight of the people, saying, ""I am innocent of the blood of this just person."" The mob, again scorning his scruples, cried, ""His blood be on us, and on our children."" Pilate was stung to the heart by their insults, and putting forth Jesus before them, said, ""Shall I crucify your King?"" The fatal moment had now come. They madly exclaimed, ""We have no king but Caesar;"" and now Jesus is given up to them, and led away to be crucified.   By the direction of Pilate an inscription was placed, according to the Roman custom, over the cross, stating the crime for which he was crucified. Having ascertained from the centurion that he was dead, he gave up the body to Joseph of Arimathea to be buried. Pilate's name now disappears from the Gospel history. References to him, however, are found in the Acts of the Apostles (  3:13  ;  4:27 ;   13:28  ), and in   1�Timothy 6:13  .

The peculiar circumstances connected with his birth are recorded in   1�Samuel 1:20  . Hannah, one of the two wives of Elkanah, who came up to Shiloh to worship before the Lord, earnestly prayed to God that she might become the mother of a son. Her prayer was graciously granted; and after the child was weaned she brought him to Shiloh nd consecrated him to the Lord as a perpetual Nazarite (  (1:23-2:11).  ). Here his bodily wants and training were attended to by the women who served in the tabernacle, while Eli cared for his religious culture. Thus, probably, twelve years of his life passed away. ""The child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the Lord, and also with men"" (  2:26  ; Compare   Luke 2:52  ). It was a time of great and growing degeneracy in Israel (  Judges 21:19-21  ;   1 Samuel 2:12-17   1 Samuel 2:22  ). The Philistines, who of late had greatly increased in number and in power, were practically masters of the country, and kept the people in subjection (  1�Samuel 10:5  ;   13:3  ).    At this time new communications from God began to be made to the pious child. A mysterious voice came to him in the night season, calling him by name, and, instructed by Eli, he answered, ""Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth."" The message that came from the Lord was one of woe and ruin to Eli and his profligate sons. Samuel told it all to Eli, whose only answer to the terrible denunciations (  1�Samuel 3:11-18  ) was, ""It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth him good"", the passive submission of a weak character, not, in his case, the expression of the highest trust and faith. The Lord revealed himself now in divers manners to Samuel, and his fame and his influence increased throughout the land as of one divinely called to the prophetical office. A new period in the history of the kingdom of God now commenced.    The Philistine yoke was heavy, and the people, groaning under the wide-spread oppression, suddenly rose in revolt, and ""went out against the Philistines to battle."" A fierce and disastrous battle was fought at Aphek, near to Ebenezer (  1 Samuel 4:1   1 Samuel 4:2  ). The Israelites were defeated, leaving 4,000 dead ""in the field."" The chiefs of the people thought to repair this great disaster by carrying with them the ark of the covenant as the symbol of Jehovah's presence. They accordingly, without consulting Samuel, fetched it out of Shiloh to the camp near Aphek. At the sight of the ark among them the people ""shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again."" A second battle was fought, and again the Philistines defeated the Israelites, stormed their camp, slew 30,000 men, and took the sacred ark. The tidings of this fatal battle was speedily conveyed to Shiloh; and so soon as the aged Eli heard that the ark of God was taken, he fell backward from his seat at the entrance of the sanctuary, and his neck brake, and he died. The tabernacle with its furniture was probably, by the advice of Samuel, now about twenty years of age, removed from Shiloh to some place of safety, and finally to Nob, where it remained many years (  21:1  ).    The Philistines followed up their advantage, and marched upon Shiloh, which they plundered and destroyed (Compare   Jeremiah 7:12  ;   Psalms 78:59  ). This was a great epoch in the history of Israel. For twenty years after this fatal battle at Aphek the whole land lay under the oppression of the Philistines. During all these dreary years Samuel was a spiritual power in the land. From Ramah, his native place, where he resided, his influence went forth on every side among the people. With unwearied zeal he went up and down from place to place, reproving, rebuking, and exhorting the people, endeavouring to awaken in them a sense of their sinfulness, and to lead them to repentance. His labours were so far successful that ""all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord."" Samuel summoned the people to Mizpeh, one of the loftiest hills in Central Palestine, where they fasted and prayed, and prepared themselves there, under his direction, for a great war against the Philistines, who now marched their whole force toward Mizpeh, in order to crush the Israelites once for all. At the intercession of Samuel God interposed in behalf of Israel. Samuel himself was their leader, the only occasion in which he acted as a leader in war. The Philistines were utterly routed. They fled in terror before the army of Israel, and a great slaughter ensued. This battle, fought probably about B.C. 1095, put an end to the forty years of Philistine oppression. In memory of this great deliverance, and in token of gratitude for the help vouchsafed, Samuel set up a great stone in the battlefield, and called it ""Ebenezer,"" saying, ""Hitherto hath the Lord helped us"" (  1�Samuel 7:1-12  ). This was the spot where, twenty years before, the Israelites had suffered a great defeat, when the ark of God was taken.    This victory over the Philistines was followed by a long period of peace for Israel (  1 Samuel 7:13   1 Samuel 7:14  ), during which Samuel exercised the functions of judge, going ""from year to year in circuit"" from his home in Ramah to Bethel, thence to Gilgal (not that in the Jordan valley, but that which lay to the west of Ebal and Gerizim), and returning by Mizpeh to Ramah. He established regular services at Shiloh, where he built an altar; and at Ramah he gathered a company of young men around him and established a school of the prophets. The schools of the prophets, thus originated, and afterwards established also at Gibeah, Bethel, Gilgal, and Jericho, exercised an important influence on the national character and history of the people in maintaining pure religion in the midst of growing corruption. They continued to the end of the Jewish commonwealth.    Many years now passed, during which Samuel exercised the functions of his judicial office, being the friend and counsellor of the people in all matters of private and public interest. He was a great statesman as well as a reformer, and all regarded him with veneration as the ""seer,"" the prophet of the Lord. At the close of this period, when he was now an old man, the elders of Israel came to him at Ramah (  1 Samuel 8:4   1 Samuel 8:5   1 Samuel 8:19-22  ); and feeling how great was the danger to which the nation was exposed from the misconduct of Samuel's sons, whom he had invested with judicial functions as his assistants, and had placed at Beersheba on the Philistine border, and also from a threatened invasion of the Ammonites, they demanded that a king should be set over them. This request was very displeasing to Samuel. He remonstrated with them, and warned them of the consequences of such a step. At length, however, referring the matter to God, he acceded to their desires, and anointed Saul (q.v.) to be their king (  11:15  ). Before retiring from public life he convened an assembly of the people at Gilgal (ch. 12), and there solemnly addressed them with reference to his own relation to them as judge and prophet.    The remainder of his life he spent in retirement at Ramah, only occasionally and in special circumstances appearing again in public (  1�Samuel 1315  ,15) with communications from God to king Saul. While mourning over the many evils which now fell upon the nation, he is suddenly summoned (ch.16) to go to Bethlehem and anoint David, the son of Jesse, as king over Israel instead of Saul. After this little is known of him till the time of his death, which took place at Ramah when he was probably about eighty years of age. ""And all Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah"" (  25:1  ), not in the house itself, but in the court or garden of his house. (Compare   2�Kings 21:18  ;   2  Chr  33:20 ;   1�Kings 2:34  ;   John 19:41  .)    Samuel's devotion to God, and the special favour with which God regarded him, are referred to in   Jeremiah 15:1   and   Psalms 99:6  .",,,122,"1Sam.1.20,1Sam.2.18,1Sam.2.21,1Sam.2.26,1Sam.3.1,1Sam.3.3,1Sam.3.4,1Sam.3.6,1Sam.3.7,1Sam.3.8,1Sam.3.9,1Sam.3.10,1Sam.3.11,1Sam.3.15,1Sam.3.16,1Sam.3.18,1Sam.3.19,1Sam.3.20,1Sam.3.21,1Sam.4.1,1Sam.7.3,1Sam.7.5,1Sam.7.6,1Sam.7.8,1Sam.7.9,1Sam.7.10,1Sam.7.12,1Sam.7.13,1Sam.7.15,1Sam.8.1,1Sam.8.4,1Sam.8.6,1Sam.8.7,1Sam.8.10,1Sam.8.19,1Sam.8.21,1Sam.8.22,1Sam.9.14,1Sam.9.15,1Sam.9.17,1Sam.9.18,1Sam.9.19,1Sam.9.22,1Sam.9.23,1Sam.9.24,1Sam.9.25,1Sam.9.26,1Sam.9.27,1Sam.10.1,1Sam.10.9,1Sam.10.14,1Sam.10.15,1Sam.10.16,1Sam.10.17,1Sam.10.20,1Sam.10.24,1Sam.10.25,1Sam.11.7,1Sam.11.12,1Sam.11.14,1Sam.12.1,1Sam.12.6,1Sam.12.11,1Sam.12.18,1Sam.12.19,1Sam.12.20,1Sam.13.8,1Sam.13.10,1Sam.13.11,1Sam.13.13,1Sam.13.15,1Sam.15.1,1Sam.15.10,1Sam.15.11,1Sam.15.12,1Sam.15.13,1Sam.15.14,1Sam.15.16,1Sam.15.17,1Sam.15.20,1Sam.15.22,1Sam.15.24,1Sam.15.26,1Sam.15.27,1Sam.15.28,1Sam.15.31,1Sam.15.32,1Sam.15.33,1Sam.15.34,1Sam.15.35,1Sam.16.1,1Sam.16.2,1Sam.16.4,1Sam.16.7,1Sam.16.8,1Sam.16.10,1Sam.16.11,1Sam.16.13,1Sam.19.18,1Sam.19.20,1Sam.19.22,1Sam.19.24,1Sam.25.1,1Sam.28.3,1Sam.28.11,1Sam.28.12,1Sam.28.14,1Sam.28.15,1Sam.28.16,1Sam.28.20,1Chr.6.28,1Chr.6.33,1Chr.9.22,1Chr.11.3,1Chr.26.28,1Chr.29.29,2Chr.35.18,Ps.99.6,Jer.15.1,Acts.3.24,Acts.13.20,Heb.11.32",hannah_1400,elkanah_1168,"abiah_15,joel_1647",,,,"Judg.1,Judg.2,Judg.3,Judg.4,Judg.5,Judg.6,Judg.7,Judg.8,Judg.9,Judg.10,Judg.11,Judg.12,Judg.13,Judg.14,Judg.15,Judg.16,Judg.17,Judg.18,Judg.19,Judg.20,Judg.21,Ruth.1,Ruth.2,Ruth.3,Ruth.4,1Sam.1,1Sam.26,1Sam.27,1Sam.28,1Sam.29,1Sam.30,1Sam.31,2Sam.1,2Sam.2,2Sam.3,2Sam.4,2Sam.5,2Sam.6,2Sam.7,2Sam.8,2Sam.9,2Sam.10,2Sam.11,2Sam.12,2Sam.13,2Sam.14,2Sam.15,2Sam.16,2Sam.17,2Sam.18,2Sam.19,2Sam.20,2Sam.21,2Sam.22,2Sam.23,2Sam.24,1Sam.2,1Sam.3,1Sam.4,1Sam.5,1Sam.6,1Sam.7,1Sam.8,1Sam.9,1Sam.10,1Sam.11,1Sam.12,1Sam.13,1Sam.14,1Sam.15,1Sam.16,1Sam.17,1Sam.18,1Sam.19,1Sam.20,1Sam.21,1Sam.22,1Sam.23,1Sam.24,1Sam.25",Samuel

In the New Testament it is used as interchangeable with Diabolos, or the devil, and is so used more than thirty times.    He is also called ""the dragon,"" ""the old serpent"" (  Revelation 12:9  ;   20:2  ); ""the prince of this world"" (  John 12:31  ;   14:30  ); ""the prince of the power of the air"" (  Ephesians 2:2  ); ""the god of this world"" (  2�Corinthians 4:4  ); ""the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience"" (  Ephesians 2:2  ).

He is ""Beelzebub, the prince of the devils"" (  12:24  ). He is ""the constant enemy of God, of Christ, of the divine kingdom, of the followers of Christ, and of all truth; full of falsehood and all malice, and exciting and seducing to evil in every possible way.""

Shelomoh), David's second son by Bathsheba, i.e., the first after their legal marriage (  2�Samuel 12  ). He was probably born about B.C. 1035 (  1�Chronicles 22:5  ;   29:1  ). He succeeded his father on the throne in early manhood, probably about sixteen or eighteen years of age. Nathan, to whom his education was intrusted, called him Jedidiah, i.e., ""beloved of the Lord"" (  2 Samuel 12:24   2 Samuel 12:25  ). He was the first king of Israel ""born in the purple."" His father chose him as his successor, passing over the claims of his elder sons: ""Assuredly Solomon my son shall reign after me."" His history is recorded in 1Kings 1-11 and 2Chr. 1-9. His elevation to the throne took place before his father's death, and was hastened on mainly by Nathan and Bathsheba, in consequence of the rebellion of Adonijah (  1�Kings 1:5-40  ). During his long reign of forty years the Hebrew monarchy gained its highest splendour. This period has well been called the ""Augustan age"" of the Jewish annals. The first half of his reign was, however, by far the brighter and more prosperous; the latter half was clouded by the idolatries into which he fell, mainly from his heathen intermarriages (  1�Kings 11:1-8  ;   1 Kings 14:21   1 Kings 14:31  ).    Before his death David gave parting instructions to his son (  1�Kings 2:1-9  ;   1�Chronicles 22:7-16  ;   28  ). As soon as he had settled himself in his kingdom, and arranged the affairs of his extensive empire, he entered into an alliance with Egypt by the marriage of the daughter of Pharaoh (  1�Kings 3:1  ), of whom, however, nothing further is recorded. He surrounded himself with all the luxuries and the external grandeur of an Eastern monarch, and his government prospered. He entered into an alliance with Hiram, king of Tyre, who in many ways greatly assisted him in his numerous undertakings. (See  HIRAM  .)   For some years before his death David was engaged in the active work of collecting materials (  1�Chronicles 29:6-9  ;   2  Chr.   2:3-7  ) for building a temple in Jerusalem as a permanent abode for the ark of the covenant. He was not permitted to build the house of God (  1�Chronicles 22:8  ); that honour was reserved to his son Solomon. (See  TEMPLE  .)   After the completion of the temple, Solomon engaged in the erection of many other buildings of importance in Jerusalem and in other parts of his kingdom. For the long space of thirteen years he was engaged in the erection of a royal palace on Ophel (  1�Kings 7:1-12  ). It was 100 cubits long, 50 broad, and 30 high. Its lofty roof was supported by forty-five cedar pillars, so that the hall was like a forest of cedar wood, and hence probably it received the name of ""The House of the Forest of Lebanon."" In front of this ""house"" was another building, which was called the Porch of Pillars, and in front of this again was the ""Hall of Judgment,"" or Throne-room (  1�Kings 7:7  ;   10:18-20  ;   2  Chr   9:17-19  ), ""the King's Gate,"" where he administered justice and gave audience to his people. This palace was a building of great magnificence and beauty. A portion of it was set apart as the residence of the queen consort, the daughter of Pharaoh. From the palace there was a private staircase of red and scented sandal wood which led up to the temple.    Solomon also constructed great works for the purpose of securing a plentiful supply of water for the city (Eccl   2:4-6  ). He then built Millo (LXX., ""Acra"") for the defence of the city, completing a line of ramparts around it (  1 Kings 9:15   1 Kings 9:24  ;   11:27  ). He erected also many other fortifications for the defence of his kingdom at various points where it was exposed to the assault of enemies (  1�Kings 9:15-19  ;   2  Chr   8:2-6  ). Among his great undertakings must also be mentioned the building of Tadmor (q.v.) in the wilderness as a commercial depot, as well as a military outpost.    During his reign Palestine enjoyed great commercial prosperity. Extensive traffic was carried on by land with Tyre and Egypt and Arabia, and by sea with Spain and India and the coasts of Africa, by which Solomon accumulated vast stores of wealth and of the produce of all nations (  1�Kings 9:26-28  ;   1 Kings 10:11   1 Kings 10:12  ;   2  Chr   1 Kings 8:17   1 Kings 8:18  ;   9:21  ). This was the ""golden age"" of Israel. The royal magnificence and splendour of Solomon's court were unrivalled. He had seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines, an evidence at once of his pride, his wealth, and his sensuality. The maintenance of his household involved immense expenditure. The provision required for one day was ""thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal, ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallow-deer, and fatted fowl"" (  1 Kings 4:22   1 Kings 4:23  ).    Solomon's reign was not only a period of great material prosperity, but was equally remarkable for its intellectual activity. He was the leader of his people also in this uprising amongst them of new intellectual life. ""He spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five. And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes"" (  1 Kings 4:32   1 Kings 4:33  ).    His fame was spread abroad through all lands, and men came from far and near ""to hear the wisdom of Solomon."" Among others thus attracted to Jerusalem was ""the queen of the south"" (  Matthew 12:42  ), the queen of Sheba, a country in Arabia Felix. ""Deep, indeed, must have been her yearning, and great his fame, which induced a secluded Arabian queen to break through the immemorial custom of her dreamy land, and to put forth the energy required for braving the burdens and perils of so long a journey across a wilderness. Yet this she undertook, and carried it out with safety."" (  1�Kings 10:1-13  ;   2  Chr   9:1-12  .) She was filled with amazement by all she saw and heard: ""there was no more spirit in her."" After an interchange of presents she returned to her native land.    But that golden age of Jewish history passed away. The bright day of Solomon's glory ended in clouds and darkness. His decline and fall from his high estate is a sad record. Chief among the causes of his decline were his polygamy and his great wealth. ""As he grew older he spent more of his time among his favourites. The idle king living among these idle women, for 1,000 women, with all their idle and mischievous attendants, filled the palaces and pleasure-houses which he had built (  1�Kings 11:3  ), learned first to tolerate and then to imitate their heathenish ways. He did not, indeed, cease to believe in the God of Israel with his mind. He did not cease to offer the usual sacrifices in the temple at the great feasts. But his heart was not right with God; his worship became merely formal; his soul, left empty by the dying out of true religious fervour, sought to be filled with any religious excitement which offered itself. Now for the first time a worship was publicly set up amongst the people of the Lord which was not simply irregular or forbidden, like that of Gideon (  Judges 8:27  ), or the Danites (  Judges 18:30   Judges 18:31  ), but was downright idolatrous."" (  1�Kings 11:7  ;   2  Kings   23:13  .)    This brought upon him the divine displeasure. His enemies prevailed against him (  1 Kings 11:14-22   1 Kings 11:23-25   1 Kings 11:26-40  ), and one judgment after another fell upon the land. And now the end of all came, and he died, after a reign of forty years, and was buried in the city of David, and ""with him was buried the short-lived glory and unity of Israel."" ""He leaves behind him but one weak and worthless son, to dismember his kingdom and disgrace his name.""    ""The kingdom of Solomon,"" says Rawlinson, ""is one of the most striking facts in the Biblical history. A petty nation, which for hundreds of years has with difficulty maintained a separate existence in the midst of warlike tribes, each of which has in turn exercised dominion over it and oppressed it, is suddenly raised by the genius of a soldier-monarch to glory and greatness. An empire is established which extends from the Euphrates to the borders of Egypt, a distance of 450 miles; and this empire, rapidly constructed, enters almost immediately on a period of peace which lasts for half a century. Wealth, grandeur, architectural magnificence, artistic excellence, commercial enterprise, a position of dignity among the great nations of the earth, are enjoyed during this space, at the end of which there is a sudden collapse. The ruling nation is split in twain, the subject-races fall off, the pre-eminence lately gained being wholly lost, the scene of struggle, strife, oppression, recovery, inglorious submission, and desperate effort, re-commences."", Historical Illustrations.",,,273,"2Sam.5.14,2Sam.12.24,2Sam.12.25,1Kgs.1.10,1Kgs.1.11,1Kgs.1.12,1Kgs.1.13,1Kgs.1.17,1Kgs.1.19,1Kgs.1.21,1Kgs.1.26,1Kgs.1.30,1Kgs.1.33,1Kgs.1.34,1Kgs.1.37,1Kgs.1.38,1Kgs.1.39,1Kgs.1.43,1Kgs.1.46,1Kgs.1.47,1Kgs.1.50,1Kgs.1.51,1Kgs.1.52,1Kgs.1.53,1Kgs.2.1,1Kgs.2.12,1Kgs.2.13,1Kgs.2.17,1Kgs.2.19,1Kgs.2.22,1Kgs.2.23,1Kgs.2.25,1Kgs.2.27,1Kgs.2.29,1Kgs.2.41,1Kgs.2.45,1Kgs.2.46,1Kgs.3.1,1Kgs.3.3,1Kgs.3.4,1Kgs.3.5,1Kgs.3.6,1Kgs.3.10,1Kgs.3.15,1Kgs.4.1,1Kgs.4.7,1Kgs.4.11,1Kgs.4.15,1Kgs.4.21,1Kgs.4.22,1Kgs.4.25,1Kgs.4.26,1Kgs.4.27,1Kgs.4.29,1Kgs.4.30,1Kgs.4.34,1Kgs.5.1,1Kgs.5.2,1Kgs.5.7,1Kgs.5.8,1Kgs.5.10,1Kgs.5.11,1Kgs.5.12,1Kgs.5.13,1Kgs.5.15,1Kgs.5.16,1Kgs.5.18,1Kgs.6.1,1Kgs.6.2,1Kgs.6.11,1Kgs.6.14,1Kgs.6.21,1Kgs.7.1,1Kgs.7.8,1Kgs.7.13,1Kgs.7.14,1Kgs.7.40,1Kgs.7.45,1Kgs.7.47,1Kgs.7.48,1Kgs.7.51,1Kgs.8.1,1Kgs.8.2,1Kgs.8.5,1Kgs.8.12,1Kgs.8.22,1Kgs.8.54,1Kgs.8.63,1Kgs.8.65,1Kgs.9.1,1Kgs.9.2,1Kgs.9.10,1Kgs.9.11,1Kgs.9.12,1Kgs.9.15,1Kgs.9.16,1Kgs.9.17,1Kgs.9.19,1Kgs.9.21,1Kgs.9.22,1Kgs.9.23,1Kgs.9.24,1Kgs.9.25,1Kgs.9.26,1Kgs.9.27,1Kgs.9.28,1Kgs.10.1,1Kgs.10.2,1Kgs.10.3,1Kgs.10.4,1Kgs.10.10,1Kgs.10.13,1Kgs.10.14,1Kgs.10.16,1Kgs.10.21,1Kgs.10.23,1Kgs.10.24,1Kgs.10.26,1Kgs.10.28,1Kgs.11.1,1Kgs.11.2,1Kgs.11.4,1Kgs.11.5,1Kgs.11.6,1Kgs.11.7,1Kgs.11.9,1Kgs.11.11,1Kgs.11.14,1Kgs.11.25,1Kgs.11.26,1Kgs.11.27,1Kgs.11.28,1Kgs.11.31,1Kgs.11.40,1Kgs.11.41,1Kgs.11.42,1Kgs.11.43,1Kgs.12.2,1Kgs.12.6,1Kgs.12.21,1Kgs.12.23,1Kgs.14.21,1Kgs.14.26,2Kgs.21.7,2Kgs.23.13,2Kgs.24.13,2Kgs.25.16,1Chr.3.5,1Chr.3.10,1Chr.6.10,1Chr.6.32,1Chr.14.4,1Chr.18.8,1Chr.22.5,1Chr.22.6,1Chr.22.7,1Chr.22.9,1Chr.22.17,1Chr.23.1,1Chr.28.5,1Chr.28.6,1Chr.28.9,1Chr.28.11,1Chr.28.20,1Chr.29.1,1Chr.29.19,1Chr.29.22,1Chr.29.23,1Chr.29.24,1Chr.29.25,1Chr.29.28,2Chr.1.1,2Chr.1.2,2Chr.1.3,2Chr.1.5,2Chr.1.6,2Chr.1.7,2Chr.1.8,2Chr.1.11,2Chr.1.13,2Chr.1.14,2Chr.1.16,2Chr.2.1,2Chr.2.2,2Chr.2.3,2Chr.2.11,2Chr.2.17,2Chr.3.1,2Chr.3.3,2Chr.4.11,2Chr.4.16,2Chr.4.18,2Chr.4.19,2Chr.5.1,2Chr.5.2,2Chr.5.6,2Chr.6.1,2Chr.6.13,2Chr.7.1,2Chr.7.5,2Chr.7.7,2Chr.7.8,2Chr.7.10,2Chr.7.11,2Chr.7.12,2Chr.8.1,2Chr.8.2,2Chr.8.3,2Chr.8.6,2Chr.8.8,2Chr.8.9,2Chr.8.10,2Chr.8.11,2Chr.8.12,2Chr.8.16,2Chr.8.17,2Chr.8.18,2Chr.9.1,2Chr.9.2,2Chr.9.3,2Chr.9.9,2Chr.9.10,2Chr.9.12,2Chr.9.13,2Chr.9.14,2Chr.9.15,2Chr.9.20,2Chr.9.22,2Chr.9.23,2Chr.9.25,2Chr.9.28,2Chr.9.29,2Chr.9.30,2Chr.9.31,2Chr.10.2,2Chr.10.6,2Chr.11.3,2Chr.11.17,2Chr.12.9,2Chr.13.6,2Chr.13.7,2Chr.30.26,2Chr.33.7,2Chr.35.3,2Chr.35.4,Ezra.2.55,Ezra.2.58,Neh.7.57,Neh.7.60,Neh.11.3,Neh.12.45,Neh.13.26,Prov.1.1,Prov.10.1,Prov.25.1,Song.1.1,Song.1.5,Song.3.7,Song.3.9,Song.3.11,Song.8.11,Song.8.12,Jer.52.20,Matt.1.6,Matt.1.7,Matt.6.29,Matt.12.42,Luke.11.31,Luke.12.27,John.10.23,Acts.3.11,Acts.5.12,Acts.7.47",bathsheba_416,david_994,"basmath_415,rehoboam_2412,taphath_2825","japhia_728,jerimoth_869,eliada_1078,eliphalet_1143,elpalet_1148,elishama_1156,elishua_1163,ibhar_1584,nathan_2152,nepheg_2179,nogah_2213,shammua_2547,shobab_2715,tamar_2822",,"absalom_59,adonijah_97,amnon_232,ithream_655,daniel_939,shephatiah_2657","Ps.72,Ps.127,Prov.1,Prov.2,Prov.3,Prov.4,Prov.5,Prov.6,Prov.7,Prov.8,Prov.9,Prov.10,Prov.11,Prov.12,Prov.13,Prov.14,Prov.15,Prov.16,Prov.17,Prov.18,Prov.19,Prov.20,Prov.21,Prov.22,Prov.23,Prov.24,Prov.25,Prov.26,Prov.27,Prov.28,Prov.29,Eccl.1,Eccl.2,Eccl.3,Eccl.4,Eccl.5,Eccl.6,Eccl.7,Eccl.8,Eccl.9,Eccl.10,Eccl.11,Eccl.12,Song.1,Song.2,Song.3,Song.4,Song.5,Song.6,Song.7,Song.8",Solomon

He was the first Christian martyr. His personal character and history are recorded in   Acts 6  . ""He fell asleep"" with a prayer for his persecutors on his lips (  7:60  ). Devout men carried him to his grave (  8:2  ).    It was at the feet of the young Pharisee, Saul of Tarsus, that those who stoned him laid their clothes (Compare   Deuteronomy 17:5-7  ) before they began their cruel work. The scene which Saul then witnessed and the words he heard appear to have made a deep and lasting impression on his mind (  Acts 22:19   Acts 22:20  ).    The speech of Stephen before the Jewish ruler is the first apology for the universalism of the gospel as a message to the Gentiles as well as the Jews. It is the longest speech contained in the Acts, a place of prominence being given to it as a defence.","Seven chosen to serve, Stephen is seized, Stephen is stoned, Stephen addresses the council, Saul persecutes the church",,7,"Acts.6.5,Acts.6.8,Acts.6.9,Acts.7.59,Acts.8.2,Acts.11.19,Acts.22.20",,,,,,,,Stephen
